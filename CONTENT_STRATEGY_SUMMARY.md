## Core Content Pillars

### 1. Skill Spotlight Videos (7-12 min)
- What: Demo + use case + insights for one skill
- Why: Highest-leverage content type
- When: 2 per week (batched Sunday)
- Benefit: Each video = 6 pieces of social content

### 2. Project Tutorials (15-25 min)
- What: Build something real using 3-4 skills together
- Why: Shows skill composition + real-world value
- When: 1 per month
- Benefit: Drives engagement + backlinks

### 3. Blog Articles (1,500-3,500 words)
- What: Written guides, comparisons, thought leadership
- Why: SEO traction + evergreen value
- When: 1-2 per week
- Benefit: Ranks for keywords + email signups

### 4. Founder Stories (3-5 min)
- What: Authentic personal perspective videos
- Why: Humanizes the project + credibility
- When: 1 per week
- Benefit: Emotional connection + shares

---

## The Content Multiplication System

**One 7-minute skill video generates:**

```
1 YouTube video (primary)
  ├─ 3 YouTube Shorts (15-45 sec each) = algorithm boost
  ├─ 1 Twitter thread (3-5 tweets) = network discovery
  ├─ 3 LinkedIn posts (micro-updates) = B2B visibility
  ├─ 1 Discord announcement = community awareness
  ├─ 1 Blog post outline = evergreen organic traffic
  └─ 1 Email teaser = newsletter engagement

Time investment: 2 hours film/edit + 30 min repurpose = 7 pieces of content
```

This is sustainable because you're not creating 7 pieces. You're creating 1 and distributing strategically.

## Key Decisions Made

### Why Video First?
- Claude Code audience: builders who learn by doing
- Video is highest-leverage content (1 → 6 pieces)
- YouTube algorithm favors consistency + watch time
- Screen recording is easier than you think

### Why Blog Second?
- SEO foundation (long-tail traffic)
- Email signups (owned audience)
- Evergreen content (doesn't stale)
- Repurpose from video transcripts

### Why Discord Over Slack?
- Discord is free + discoverable
- Better for async community
- Lower barrier to entry (no invite needed)
- Stickier for long-term community

### Why No TikTok/Instagram as Primary?
- Developer audience isn't primarily TikTok
- Short-form distorts technical content
- Cross-posting YouTube Shorts is sufficient
- Stick to where your audience actually is

### Why Win31 Aesthetic Matters
- Only truly unique visual branding
- Creates recognition + recall
- Attracts developers with taste
- Defensible position (nobody else doing this)

## Success Dependencies

### What You Control
✅ Content consistency (publishing schedule)
✅ Content quality (effort + refinement)
✅ Community engagement (responding promptly)
✅ Strategy execution (following the calendar)

### What You Don't Control
❌ YouTube algorithm (but consistency helps)
❌ Network effects (but good content compounds)
❌ Speed of Claude Code adoption (but early positioning pays off)
❌ Competitor moves (but quality is defensible)

**Focus on what you control. Compounding does the rest.**

## Potential Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Video production is hard"** | Start with blog, transcribe into posts. Audio quality matters less than content. |
| **"I'm too busy"** | Batch content weekly (3 hours). Most of the time is waiting for uploads. |
| **"Community isn't growing"** | Growth follows good content. Make better videos first, promote second. |
| **"No one's watching my videos"** | YouTube algorithm takes 2-4 weeks to learn your channel. Post 10 before judging. |
| **"Blog traffic is low"** | SEO takes months. Keep publishing. Rank in month 3, explode month 6+. |
| **"I don't have technical skills"** | You built 48 skills. That IS technical credibility. Just teach what you know. |

---

## Revenue Opportunities (After Month 3)

**These aren't the goal, but they emerge naturally:**

1. **YouTube Monetization** (10k subs → ad revenue)
2. **Sponsorships** (AI tool companies want placement)
3. **Affiliate Links** (Claude API, related tools)
4. **Premium Tier** (advanced tutorials, masterclasses)
5. **Consulting** (custom skills, team training)
6. **Course** (comprehensive "Master Claude Code Skills")

**Note:** Focus on audience first. Money follows.

- Erich's voice is your advantage

- Creators win through honesty

## Final Thought

**You're not competing on production value. You're competing on clarity, authenticity, and curation.**

The Claude Code space is early. Most people are confused about what skills are and how to use them. You built them. You understand the "why."

By teaching clearly, showing real examples, and treating your audience like intelligent professionals, you'll build an audience that grows faster than you expect.

**The next 90 days are about showing up consistently. Do that, and the rest takes care of itself.**
