# The Trust Ladder

## Trust Requirements by Stage

### Level 0: Landing

User has just arrived. Subconscious checks:
- [ ] URL looks legitimate (no typos, proper domain)
- [ ] HTTPS / padlock icon
- [ ] Page loads in &lt;3 seconds
- [ ] No browser security warnings
- [ ] No popup overload

**If failing**: Visitor bounces immediately.

### Level 1: Click/Explore

User is willing to look around:
- [ ] Professional design (no broken images, misaligned elements)
- [ ] Clear navigation (obvious where to go)
- [ ] Fast interactions (no lag on hover, click)
- [ ] Mobile-friendly if on mobile
- [ ] No aggressive popups

**If failing**: Visitor leaves within 10 seconds.

### Level 2: Spend Time (&gt;2 min)

User is interested enough to read/explore:
- [ ] Value demonstrated quickly (don't bury the lead)
- [ ] Progress indicators if multi-step
- [ ] Content is scannable (headers, bullets, images)
- [ ] Easy to leave without feeling trapped
- [ ] No autoplaying video with sound

**If failing**: Visitor skims and leaves.

### Level 3: Enter Personal Info

User considers sharing email, name, etc:
- [ ] Why you need it is explained
- [ ] Privacy policy linked and accessible
- [ ] Minimal fields required (only what's necessary)
- [ ] No dark patterns (pre-checked marketing boxes)
- [ ] Security indicators present

**If failing**: User abandons form.

### Level 4: Create Account

User is committing to a relationship:
- [ ] Social login options (reduce friction)
- [ ] Email-only option (don't force social)
- [ ] Clear benefit of having account
- [ ] Password requirements reasonable
- [ ] No surprise requirements after signup

**If failing**: User creates account but never returns.

### Level 5: Pay Money

User trusts you with their money:
- [ ] Money-back guarantee (30 days standard)
- [ ] Recognizable payment processor (Stripe, PayPal)
- [ ] Clear pricing (no hidden fees revealed at checkout)
- [ ] Testimonials from paying customers
- [ ] Easy cancellation policy visible

**If failing**: User abandons cart.

## Common Trust Violations

### Asking Too Much Too Soon

**Wrong**: "Enter your email to see our pricing"
**Right**: Show pricing openly, ask for email to get trial

**Wrong**: "Create account to browse features"
**Right**: Let them explore, ask for account to save progress

### Dark Patterns That Kill Trust

| Pattern | What It Looks Like | Better Alternative |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Confirm-shaming | "No thanks, I don't want to save money" | "No thanks" or "Maybe later" |
| Hidden costs | Fees revealed at checkout | Show total price upfront |
| Forced continuity | Free trial auto-converts | Clear reminder before charge |
| Roach motel | Easy signup, impossible cancel | One-click cancel |
| Misdirection | Tiny "no" button, huge "yes" | Equal prominence for both |

### Missing Trust Signals by Industry

| Industry | Expected Signals | Users Get Suspicious Without |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **E-commerce** | SSL, reviews, return policy | Payment badges |
| **SaaS** | Customer logos, testimonials | Security certifications |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA badge, credentials | Privacy policy |
| **Finance** | Regulatory compliance, encryption | Security details |
| **Education** | Accreditation, outcomes data | Instructor credentials |

## Trust Audit Checklist

For each commitment level you're asking for, answer:

1. **What trust signals are present at this stage?**
   - List every trust-building element visible

2. **What objections might arise here?**
   - Put yourself in a skeptical user's shoes

3. **What's missing that competitors provide?**
   - Compare against 2-3 alternatives

4. **Is the ask proportional to the value shown?**
   - Users should feel they've received more than they've given

## Optimizing Trust Flow

### Progressive Value Revelation

```
WRONG:
  Land → Account required → [Wall] → See value

RIGHT:
  Land → See partial value → Want more → Account → Full value
```

### Trust-Building Sequence

1. **Demonstrate** before asking
2. **Explain** why you need what you're asking for
3. **Offer** alternatives (social login, guest checkout)
4. **Reduce** risk (guarantee, free trial)
5. **Prove** with social proof matching their persona
