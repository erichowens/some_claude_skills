# Objection Catalog

Every user has objections. Great products acknowledge and address them before users articulate them.

## The 7 Universal Objections

| Objection | Type | What They're Really Asking |
|-----------|------|---------------------------|
| "Is this legit?" | Trust | "Can I trust you with my data/money?" |
| "I've tried things before" | Skepticism | "Why is this different?" |
| "Too expensive" | Value | "Is this worth it?" |
| "Too complicated" | Effort | "How much work is this?" |
| "Not for people like me" | Identity | "Is this made for someone like me?" |
| "What if it doesn't work?" | Risk | "What do I lose if it fails?" |
| "I'll do it later" | Urgency | "Why now vs. someday?" |
