## Priority Formula

Calculate recommendation priority:

```
Priority = (Users Affected × Severity) / Fix Difficulty

Where:
- Users Affected: 1-100 (percentage)
- Severity: 1-10 (impact on conversion)
- Fix Difficulty: 1-10 (effort required, lower is easier)

Example:
- Confusing headline: (100% × 9) / 3 = 300 → HIGH PRIORITY
- Missing testimonials: (80% × 6) / 5 = 96 → MEDIUM PRIORITY
- Footer links broken: (10% × 4) / 2 = 20 → LOW PRIORITY
```
