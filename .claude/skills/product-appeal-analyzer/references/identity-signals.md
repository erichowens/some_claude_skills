# Identity Signals Catalog

People choose products that reinforce who they are or want to be. This reference catalogs the signals that communicate "this is for people like you."

## The Identity Principle

**Users don't choose the best product—they choose the product that feels most made for them.**

Identity signals answer:
- "Is this for people like me?"
- "Will people like me be represented?"
- "Does using this align with who I want to be?"

## Identity Mismatch Anti-Patterns

### Trying to Appeal to Everyone

**Symptom**: Homepage shows enterprise logos AND indie testimonials AND student pricing
**Problem**: No one feels it's for them specifically
**Fix**: Choose primary persona, make others secondary

### Aspirational Mismatch

**Symptom**: Premium visual design but budget pricing
**Problem**: Users expect premium = expensive
**Fix**: Align visual identity with price positioning

### Social Proof Disconnect

**Symptom**: Enterprise testimonials but indie pricing
**Problem**: "Why is it so cheap? What's wrong?"
**Fix**: Use social proof matching your actual customer base

### Tone Inconsistency

**Symptom**: "Crush your goals" headline, "gentle journey" body copy
**Problem**: Feels like two different products
**Fix**: Unify tone across all touchpoints
