# CV Creator

A specialized resume builder that transforms structured career data and competitive positioning insights into ATS-optimized, professionally formatted resumes and CVs.

## Quick Start

**Minimal example to generate a resume:**

```
User: "Create a resume for senior software engineer roles"

CV Creator:
1. Request CareerProfile (from biographer or direct input)
2. Request PositioningStrategy (from cartographer or skip)
3. Request target role/company (optional for optimization)
4. Generate resume with clean formatting
5. Calculate ATS score and provide recommendations
6. Export in requested formats (PDF, DOCX, JSON Resume)
```

### 4. Strategic Integration

#### From Career Biographer

```typescript
interface CareerProfile {
  // Identity
  name: string;
  headline: string;
  summary: string;

  // Timeline
  timelineEvents: Array<{
    date: string;
    type: 'role_change' | 'patent' | 'award' | 'publication' | 'milestone';
    title: string;
    description: string;
    impact: string;
    tags: string[];
  }>;

  // Skills
  skills: Array<{
    category: 'technical' | 'leadership' | 'domain' | 'soft';
    name: string;
    proficiency: number; // 0-100
    yearsOfExperience: number;
  }>;

  // Projects
  projects: Array<{
    name: string;
    role: string;
    description: string;
    technologies: string[];
    impact: string;
    metrics: string[];
  }>;
}
```

#### From Competitive Cartographer

```typescript
interface PositioningStrategy {
  positioning: {
    headline: string;
    differentiators: string[];
    messaging: string;
  };

  contentStrategy: {
    tone: string;
    depth: string;
  };
}
```

## Resume Generation Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Inputs

**Required:**
- CareerProfile (from biographer or user-provided JSON)

**Optional but recommended:**
- PositioningStrategy (from cartographer)
- Target Role (e.g., "Senior Backend Engineer")
- Target Company (e.g., "Google")
- Job Description URL or text (for keyword optimization)

### Step 2: Generate Professional Summary

Transform career data into a compelling 2-4 line summary:

**Formula:**
```
[Seniority Level] + [Technical Focus] with [Years] years building [Domain].
[Key Achievement with Metric]. Expertise in [Top 3-5 Skills].
[Current Goal or Target Role].
```

**Example:**
```
Senior Backend Engineer with 8 years building scalable distributed systems.
Led microservices migration serving 10M+ users with 40% latency reduction.
Expertise in Go, Kubernetes, gRPC, and cloud-native architecture.
Seeking principal engineering role focused on infrastructure optimization.
```

**What to avoid:**
- Generic buzzwords ("passionate", "results-oriented")
- Objective statements ("Seeking a challenging role...")
- Listing achievements (save for Work Experience section)

### Step 3: Create Core Skills Section

Select and prioritize 15-20 technical skills:

**Prioritization criteria:**
1. Mentioned in job description (if provided)
2. Highest proficiency level from CareerProfile
3. Most years of experience
4. Relevant to target role

**Format:**
```
Core Skills:
Go, Kubernetes, Docker, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices Architecture,
Distributed Systems, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, System Design, API Design,
Performance Optimization, Monitoring & Observability
```

**What to avoid:**
- Generic skills ("Problem Solving", "Team Player")
- Too many skills (>25 overwhelming, <10 insufficient)
- Listing skills not mentioned elsewhere in resume

### Step 4: Format Work Experience

Transform timeline events into results-oriented bullet points:

**Bullet point formula:**
```
[Action Verb] + [What you did] + [How/Why you did it] + [Quantifiable Result]
```

**Examples:**
```
✓ Led microservices migration from monolith architecture, reducing API latency by 40% and improving deployment frequency from weekly to daily releases

✓ Architected event-driven system handling 10M+ daily active users using Kubernetes, Go, and gRPC with 99.99% uptime SLA

✓ Mentored team of 5 junior engineers through code reviews and pair programming, resulting in 50% faster onboarding time and promotion of 3 engineers within 18 months
```

**Common action verbs:**
- **Leadership**: Led, Managed, Directed, Coordinated, Mentored
- **Technical**: Architected, Built, Designed, Implemented, Optimized
- **Impact**: Reduced, Increased, Improved, Accelerated, Scaled
- **Innovation**: Pioneered, Created, Launched, Introduced, Developed

**What to avoid:**
- Starting with "Responsible for..." or "Duties included..."
- Listing technologies without context
- Vague metrics ("significantly improved", "greatly reduced")
- Bullets longer than 2 lines

### Step 5: Format Education

Keep education section concise:

**Format:**
```
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
University of California, Berkeley | 2015

Master of Science in Distributed Systems
Stanford University | 2017
```

**When to include GPA:**
- Recent graduate (<5 years) AND GPA ≥3.5
- Otherwise, omit

**What to avoid:**
- Listing coursework (unless applying for first job)
- Including high school education
- Redundant information (location if already in header)

### Step 6: Apply Template Styling

Select appropriate template based on:
- Target industry (tech = Minimalist, finance = Traditional)
- Career stage (early career = cleaner, senior = more content)
- Personal brand (creative roles = Creative Hybrid)
- Academic roles = Academic CV template

### Step 7: Generate ATS Analysis

Calculate ATS score based on:

**Formatting Compliance (30 points):**
- Single-column layout: 10 points
- Standard fonts: 10 points
- No graphics/images: 10 points

**Section Structure (20 points):**
- Has Professional Summary: 5 points
- Has Core Skills: 5 points
- Has Work Experience: 5 points
- Has Education: 5 points

**Content Quality (30 points):**
- Summary length 100-500 chars: 10 points
- Skills section 10-25 skills: 10 points
- Experience bullets have metrics: 10 points

**Keyword Optimization (20 points):**
- If job description provided: calculate keyword coverage
- If not: award 15 points for general optimization

**Total Score:** 0-100

### Step 8: Provide Recommendations

Generate specific, actionable improvements:

**Example recommendations:**
```
ATS Score: 87/100

✓ Strengths:
- Clean single-column formatting passes ATS parsing
- Professional summary is concise and role-specific
- Work experience bullets include quantifiable metrics

⚠️ Improvements:
- Add "Terraform" to Core Skills section (mentioned 3x in job description)
- Increase keyword coverage from 75% to 85% by including "CI/CD pipeline"
- Consider adding certification section with "AWS Certified Solutions Architect"
```

## Best Practices

### Content Optimization

**1. Lead with Impact, Not Responsibilities**
❌ "Responsible for maintaining database infrastructure"
✓ "Optimized database queries and indexing strategy, reducing query latency by 60% and infrastructure costs by $50K annually"

**2. Use Specific Metrics**
❌ "Improved system performance"
✓ "Reduced API response time from 500ms to 200ms (60% improvement)"

**3. Show Career Progression**
❌ Listing same responsibilities for each role
✓ Each role shows increased scope, leadership, or technical complexity

**4. Tailor for Each Application**
- Reorder skills to match job description priority
- Emphasize relevant experience in recent roles
- Adjust professional summary for target company

### Formatting Rules

**Do:**
- ✓ Use standard fonts (Calibri, Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman)
- ✓ Font size 10-12pt for body, 14-16pt for headers
- ✓ Single-column layout (no tables, no text boxes)
- ✓ Standard section headers ("Work Experience", not "My Journey")
- ✓ Consistent date format (MM/YYYY or Month YYYY)
- ✓ Plain bullet points (•, -, or standard symbols)
- ✓ Margins 0.5-1 inch

**Don't:**
- ✗ Use graphics, images, logos, or headshots
- ✗ Include headers/footers (info can be lost in ATS)
- ✗ Use tables or columns
- ✗ Add special characters or emojis
- ✗ Use creative section names
- ✗ Include personal information (age, marital status, photo)

### Length Guidelines

**1 page:** Entry-level (0-3 years experience)
**1-2 pages:** Mid-level (3-10 years experience)
**2 pages:** Senior-level (10+ years experience)

**Never exceed 2 pages**, even for very senior roles.

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Creative Resume for Tech Roles

**What it looks like:** Colorful infographics, skill bars, profile photo, two-column layout
**Why it's wrong:** ATS systems can't parse graphics or complex layouts; resume gets filtered out
**What to do instead:** Use Modern Minimalist template with clean, single-column text format

### Anti-Pattern: Generic Objective Statement

**What it looks like:** "Seeking a challenging role in a growth-oriented company..."
**Why it's wrong:** Wastes valuable space, provides no information, sounds like every other resume
**What to do instead:** Use professional summary with specific metrics and target role

### Anti-Pattern: Listing Every Technology Ever Used

**What it looks like:** 40+ skills in Core Skills section, including outdated technologies
**Why it's wrong:** Dilutes expertise, makes it unclear what you're actually proficient in
**What to do instead:** List 15-20 most relevant skills for target role, focus on depth over breadth

### Anti-Pattern: Responsibilities Without Outcomes

**What it looks like:** "Managed a team", "Worked on backend systems", "Responsible for deployments"
**Why it's wrong:** Doesn't show impact, value, or what was actually achieved
**What to do instead:** "Led team of 5 engineers to deliver microservices migration, reducing deployment time by 70%"

### Anti-Pattern: Inconsistent Formatting

**What it looks like:** Mixed date formats (2020-01, Jan 2021, February 2022), different bullet styles, varying fonts
**Why it's wrong:** Looks unprofessional, confuses ATS parsers, harder to scan
**What to do instead:** Maintain strict consistency: same date format, same bullet style, same font throughout

## When to Use

✅ Use cv-creator when:
- Creating a resume from career-biographer data
- Optimizing existing resume for specific job posting
- Generating multiple resume variants for different roles
- Need ATS score and improvement recommendations
- Require multi-format export (PDF, DOCX, JSON Resume)
- Want strategic positioning incorporated (via cartographer)

❌ Do NOT use cv-creator when:
- Writing cover letters (different format and purpose)
- Creating portfolio websites (use web-design-expert)
- LinkedIn profile optimization (update directly)
- Interview preparation (use interview prep skills)
- Career counseling or job search strategy (use career coach skills)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: ATS Score <70

**Possible causes:**
- Complex formatting (tables, columns, text boxes)
- Graphics or images in resume
- Non-standard fonts or section headers
- Missing critical sections

**Fix:**
1. Switch to Minimalist template
2. Remove all graphics, images, logos
3. Use standard section headers ("Work Experience", "Education")
4. Ensure all required sections present

### Issue: Keyword Coverage <60%

**Possible causes:**
- Not tailoring resume to specific job description
- Using different terminology than job posting
- Skills not explicitly stated in Core Skills section

**Fix:**
1. Extract keywords from job description
2. Add missing keywords to Core Skills (if genuinely possess skill)
3. Incorporate job description language in experience bullets
4. Use exact terminology from posting (e.g., "Kubernetes" not "K8s")

### Issue: Resume Exceeds 2 Pages

**Possible causes:**
- Including every role from entire career
- Too many bullet points per role
- Verbose descriptions

**Fix:**
1. Consolidate older roles (>10 years ago) into single "Early Career" section
2. Limit recent roles to 7-10 bullets, older roles to 3-5 bullets
3. Remove bullet points not relevant to target role
4. Trim each bullet to 1-2 lines maximum
5. Remove optional sections (Volunteer, Hobbies)

### Issue: Professional Summary Sounds Generic

**Possible causes:**
- Not incorporating positioning insights from cartographer
- Using template language instead of specific achievements
- Lacking target role focus

**Fix:**
1. Include specific metric from top achievement
2. Name exact technologies/skills (not "various technologies")
3. State clear career goal or target role
4. Use positioning differentiators from cartographer (if available)

### Issue: Work Experience Bullets Too Long

**Possible causes:**
- Trying to explain entire project in one bullet
- Including unnecessary technical details
- Not editing for conciseness

**Fix:**
1. Split complex achievements into multiple bullets
2. Focus on outcome, not every implementation detail
3. Use strong action verbs to convey more with fewer words
4. Aim for 1 line per bullet (max 2 lines for major achievements)

## Success Metrics

A well-generated resume should achieve:

- **ATS Score**: 85+ out of 100
- **Keyword Coverage**: 80%+ for job-specific variants
- **Length**: 1-2 pages (strict maximum)
- **Parsing Errors**: 0 when tested through ATS simulator
- **Readability**: Scannable in <30 seconds by recruiter
- **Format Compliance**: Passes all formatting checks

## Integration with Other Skills
