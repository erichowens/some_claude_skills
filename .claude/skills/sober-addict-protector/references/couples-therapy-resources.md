# Couples Therapy in Recovery: Why It's Essential

## The Case for Couples Therapy

### The Statistics

```
RELATIONSHIPS AND RECOVERY
──────────────────────────

Without couples/family therapy:
├── 40-60% of relationships end within first year of recovery
├── Relationship stress is top relapse trigger
├── Partners often develop their own mental health issues
└── Children show behavioral problems in 60%+ of families

With couples/family therapy:
├── Relationship survival rate increases to 70%+
├── Relapse rates decrease by 20-30%
├── Partner mental health improves significantly
├── Children show marked behavioral improvement
└── Communication satisfaction doubles

```

### Why It's Not Optional

```
THE RELATIONSHIP WAS AFFECTED
─────────────────────────────

Even if you used alone, addiction touched your relationship:
├── Trust was broken (lies, hiding use, broken promises)
├── Emotional availability was compromised
├── Financial damage may have occurred
├── Intimacy suffered
├── Parenting was affected
├── Communication patterns became toxic
└── Your partner experienced their own trauma

YOUR PARTNER NEEDS SUPPORT TOO
──────────────────────────────

Partners often experience:
├── Hypervigilance (watching for signs of use)
├── Anxiety and depression
├── Codependency patterns
├── Their own PTSD symptoms
├── Loss of self (identity consumed by your addiction)
├── Anger and resentment (even in recovery)
└── Fear of the other shoe dropping

RECOVERY CHANGES THE RELATIONSHIP
─────────────────────────────────

You're becoming a different person. That means:
├── Old dynamics don't work anymore
├── Power balance shifts
├── New boundaries are needed
├── Partner may struggle with the changes
├── "I don't know who you are anymore"
└── Need to rebuild from a new foundation
```

## Types of Couples Therapy

### Behavioral Couples Therapy (BCT)

```
BEHAVIORAL COUPLES THERAPY
──────────────────────────

├── Combines recovery support with relationship work
├── Daily "recovery contract" between partners
├── 12-20 sessions typically
└── Strong research support

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. Daily Trust Discussion
   ├── Person in recovery states intention to stay sober today
   ├── Partner expresses support
   └── Acknowledges recovery efforts

2. Catch Your Partner Doing Something Nice
   ├── Daily positive acknowledgment
   ├── Rebuilds positive interaction ratio
   └── Counters negativity bias

3. Shared Activities

```

### Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)

```
EMOTIONALLY FOCUSED THERAPY
───────────────────────────

WHAT IT IS:
├── Attachment-based approach
├── Focuses on emotional bonds
├── Identifies negative cycles
├── Creates secure connection
└── 8-20 sessions typically

THE THREE STAGES:

Stage 1: De-escalation
├── Identify the negative cycle
├── Access underlying emotions
├── See the pattern, not the "problem partner"
└── "We're caught in a cycle, not fighting each other"

Stage 2: Restructuring
├── Access deeper attachment needs
├── Express fears and longings
├── Partner responds with empathy
└── Create new bonding experiences

Stage 3: Consolidation
├── Integrate new patterns
├── Build positive cycles
├── Solidify secure attachment
└── Address remaining issues

BEST FOR:
├── Couples with attachment injuries
├── Trust repair needed
├── Emotional disconnection
├── Both partners can access emotions
└── Deeper relational work desired
```

### Gottman Method

```
GOTTMAN METHOD
──────────────

BASED ON:
├── 40+ years of research
├── "Love Lab" observational studies
├── Predictors of divorce identified
├── Practical skill-building focus
└── Sound Relationship House model

THE FOUR HORSEMEN (to avoid):
1. Criticism: Attacking character, not behavior

3. Defensiveness: Playing victim, counter-attacking
   → Antidote: Accept responsibility (even small part)

4. Stonewalling: Shutting down, withdrawing
   → Antidote: Physiological self-soothing, take breaks

KEY SKILLS:
├── Soft startup for complaints
├── Accepting influence from partner
├── Making and responding to repair attempts
├── Creating shared meaning
├── Building love maps (knowing partner's world)

├── Conflict management issues
├── Prevention/maintenance

## Finding a Therapist

### What to Look For

```
QUALIFICATIONS
──────────────
ESSENTIAL:
├── Licensed (LMFT, LCSW, PsyD, PhD)
├── Training in couples therapy specifically
├── Understanding of addiction/recovery
└── Experience with your population

PREFERRED:
├── Certification in specific modality (BCT, EFT, Gottman)
├── CASAC or addiction credential
├── Trauma-informed approach
└── Personal recovery experience (optional but valuable)

RED FLAGS:

├── No addiction understanding
├── Pushes separation agenda
├── Doesn't ask about recovery status
└── Individual therapy only (not couples-trained)
```

### Questions to Ask Potential Therapists

```
1. "What's your training in couples therapy?"
   Look for: Specific modality training, not just general license

2. "What experience do you have with addiction and recovery?"
   Look for: Understanding of recovery process, MAT-friendly

3. "How do you typically structure sessions?"
   Look for: Both partners speak, homework between sessions

4. "What's your approach when one partner is in recovery?"
   Look for: Balance between recovery support and relationship work

5. "How do you handle potential relapse?"
   Look for: Safety plan, not abandonment of couples work

6. "What can we expect in terms of progress/timeline?"
   Look for: Realistic expectations, not quick fixes

## The Partner's Perspective

### What Partners Need

```
PARTNERS ARE NOT:

├── ❌ Responsible for your recovery
├── ❌ Required to forget what happened
├── ❌ "Cured" when you get sober
└── ❌ Obligated to stay (their choice)

PARTNERS NEED:
├── Their own support (Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, therapy)
├── Time to process their own trauma
├── Permission to have feelings (anger is valid)
├── Clear, consistent follow-through from you
├── Recognition of what they went through
├── Patience (trust takes TIME)
└── To see sustained change, not just words

WHAT YOU CAN DO:
├── Acknowledge their pain without defensiveness
├── Follow through on commitments consistently
├── Support their own recovery journey
├── Accept that forgiveness takes time
├── Show up for couples therapy sessions
└── Do the homework between sessions
```

## The Conversation: Asking for Couples Therapy

### Script for Bringing It Up

```
"I've been thinking about us and our relationship.
I know my addiction affected you deeply, and I want
to make things right. But I realize I can't do that
alone, and neither can you.

I'd like us to try couples therapy—not because
something is wrong with us, but because we've been
through something hard and we deserve support to
rebuild.

What do you think? Would you be open to exploring this?"

IF THEY'RE RESISTANT:
"I hear that you're hesitant. Can you tell me more
about what concerns you?"

Common concerns:
├── "We don't need help" → "I think we could benefit
│   from learning new skills together"
├── "It's too expensive" → "Let's look at options.
│   What about sliding scale or insurance?"
├── "I don't want to air our dirty laundry"
│   → "What's said stays confidential"
├── "You're the one with the problem"
│   → "You're right that I'm the one who used.
│   And my addiction affected both of us."
```

## What to Expect in Sessions

**Bottom line**: Couples therapy isn't a sign that your relationship is failing—it's a sign that you're both committed to its success. The relationship was wounded. It deserves care.
