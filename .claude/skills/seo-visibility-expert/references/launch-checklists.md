---

## Hacker News Launch

### Before Posting

**Content Prep**
- [ ] Write genuine Show HN post (not marketing fluff)
- [ ] Focus on technical interesting bits
- [ ] Have a "why I built this" story ready
- [ ] Prepare honest answers for tough questions
- [ ] Read HN guidelines thoroughly

**Title Formulas That Work**

```
Show HN: [Tool Name] – [Plain English description]
Example: Show HN: Vite – A faster alternative to Webpack

Show HN: I built [X] to solve [problem I had]
Example: Show HN: I built a CLI to manage my dotfiles across machines

[Interesting technical finding] (with data/results)
Example: We analyzed 1M npm packages and found 23% have CVEs
```

**What NOT to Write**

```
❌ "Revolutionary AI-powered solution..."
❌ "The Uber of X..."
❌ "Disrupting the Y industry..."
❌ Any marketing-speak
❌ Buzzword salads
```

### Posting Strategy

**Timing**
- Best: 6-8 AM PST, Tuesday-Thursday
- Good: Weekday mornings PST
- Avoid: Weekends (lower engagement for technical content)
- Avoid: Major news days

**The Post**

```
Title: Show HN: [Your Tool] – [What it does simply]

Body (as first comment, not in submission):
- What it is (1-2 sentences)
- Why you built it (personal story)
- Technical approach (what makes it interesting)
- What you learned
- What's next
- Honest limitations

Keep it under 300 words. Be humble.
```

### During the Post

### HN Survival Tips

**When criticized:**
- Acknowledge valid points
- Explain your reasoning without being defensive

→ "Great question! I actually started with X but found [specific limitation]. Here's what I tried..."

"This has been done before"
→ "Totally! I was inspired by [previous work]. The main difference is [specific technical choice]..."

"Who is this for?"
→ "[Specific user type] who are dealing with [specific problem]. Here's an example..."
```

Example: "Open source alternative to [X] - looking for feedback"

r/InternetIsBeautiful:
Focus on the cool factor, not the tech
Example: "A tool that visualizes your Spotify listening history"
```

**Post Body Structure**
