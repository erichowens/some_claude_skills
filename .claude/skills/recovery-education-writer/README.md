# Recovery Education Writer Skill

## Overview

This skill enables writing neuroscientific, peer-oriented drug education content that reduces shame through scientific understanding. It combines lived experience voice with accessible neuroscience to explain recovery phenomena.

## Purpose

Write educational content that:
- Roots experiences in body/brain mechanisms
- Explains phenomena users feel lonely about
- Uses neuroscience/cognitive psychology frameworks
- Maintains peer voice (not clinical distance)
- Reduces shame through scientific understanding
- Provides hope grounded in research

## Core Files

### SKILL.md
Main skill definition with:
- Content structure template (Hook → Science → Timeline → Normalize → Action)
- Writing voice guidelines (DO/DON'T)
- Common topics and frameworks
- Research integration best practices
- Content checklist

### references/neuroscience-of-addiction.md
Core neuroscience concepts:
- Brain's reward system (dopamine, VTA, nucleus accumbens)
- Salience network (pattern detection → paranoia)
- GABA/glutamate (anxiety, insomnia)
- Neuroplasticity (healing timelines)
- PAWS mechanisms
- Cue-induced craving (classical conditioning)
- Sleep architecture in recovery
- Emotional regulation systems

### references/paws-timeline.md
Comprehensive PAWS reference:
- Timeline by substance (stimulants, opioids, alcohol, benzos, cannabis)
- The 6-week wall explained
- Symptom categories (emotional, cognitive, physical, behavioral)
- Management strategies (exercise, sleep, nutrition, therapy)
- Month-by-month expectations
- Red flags requiring professional help

### references/harm-reduction-principles.md
Harm reduction philosophy for writing:
- Meet people where they are
- Avoid shame and stigma
- Include safer use information
- Validate all recovery pathways (abstinence, MAT, harm reduction)
- Language guidelines (avoid "addict," "clean/dirty")
- Overdose prevention information
- MAT destigmatization

### references/writing-voice-examples.md
Annotated examples:
- Full article examples (meth paranoia, anhedonia, using dreams)
- Voice characteristic breakdown
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Before/after comparisons

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- Writing educational articles about drugs and recovery
- Explaining "weird" recovery phenomena (using dreams, emotional flatness, paranoia)
- Creating harm reduction content
- Answering "why is this happening to me?" questions
- Translating neuroscience research into peer language
- Validating stigmatized experiences through science

## Example Topics

- "Why Meth Creates Paranoia" - salience network, dopamine floods
- "The 6-Week Wall" - anhedonia, dopamine receptor recovery
- "Why Everyone Seems Fake" - emotional recalibration
- "Using Dreams Don't Mean Failure" - REM consolidation, neural pruning
- "Why You Can't Sleep Sober" - GABA/glutamate rebalancing
- "Cravings Feel Physical Because..." - cue-induced dopamine anticipation
- "PAWS: When Recovery Gets Harder" - timeline and management

## Key Principles

### Content Structure
Every piece follows this arc:
1. **Hook:** Personal vulnerability (2-3 sentences)
2. **Science:** Mechanism in accessible terms (1-2 paragraphs)
3. **Timeline:** Research-based recovery timeline (1 paragraph)
4. **Normalize:** Explicitly counter shame (2-3 sentences)
5. **Action:** Concrete next steps (3-5 bullet points)

### Voice Guidelines
- Speak from experience ("When I was using...")
- Use accessible language ("pattern detector" not "salience network")
- Acknowledge difficulty ("This is hard. Really hard.")
- Be curious, not preachy ("I wondered why..." not "You should know...")
- Offer hope grounded in science ("Studies show...")

### What to Avoid
- Scare tactics (they backfire)
- Glamorizing the high
- Oversimplifying recovery timelines
- Judging people still using
- Clinical distance ("patients," "subjects")
- Toxic positivity ("Just stay positive!")

## Integration with Other Skills

- **crisis-response-protocol**: Crisis content (suicidal ideation, safety plans)
- **recovery-community-moderator**: Forum posts needing education + moderation
- **recovery-coach-patterns**: One-on-one coaching with psychoeducation
- **modern-drug-rehab-computer**: Medication/MAT information
- **jungian-psychologist**: Depth psychology integration

## Usage Example

```bash
# Invoke skill
/recovery-education-writer

# Example prompt
"Write an article explaining why people in early meth recovery
feel like everyone around them is fake or shallow. Cover the
neuroscience, normalize the experience, and provide a timeline
for when social connection feels genuine again."
```

**Remember:** Your job is to help people understand what's happening in their brain so they feel less alone and more hopeful. Science is the antidote to shame.
