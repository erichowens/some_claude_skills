# Maximalist Color Combinations

## The Philosophy of Bold Color

```
MINIMALIST THINKING:
"Neutral walls make a room feel larger and calmer."

MAXIMALIST THINKING:
"Neutral walls make a room feel boring and forgettable."

THE TRUTH:
Both are valid. But you're here for BOLD. Let's go.
```

## Foolproof Combinations

```
JEWEL TONES TOGETHER

## Color Mixing Rules

### The 60-30-10 Rule (For Beginners)

```
CLASSIC PROPORTION
──────────────────

60% - Dominant color (walls, large furniture)
30% - Secondary color (upholstery, textiles)
10% - Accent color (accessories, art)

EXAMPLE:
├── 60% Navy blue walls
├── 30% Blush pink sofa and curtains
└── 10% Gold accessories and frames
```

### The Maximalist Revision

```
MAXIMALIST PROPORTION
─────────────────────

40% - Primary color (still dominant, but less)
25% - Secondary color (substantial presence)
20% - Third color (yes, three major colors!)
15% - Accent colors + metallics (plural!)

EXAMPLE:
├── 40% Deep green walls
├── 25% Pink velvet furniture
├── 20% Mustard textiles and rug
└── 15% Blue and gold accents

THE KEY: Colors should RELATE but not MATCH
```

### The Chaos Coordination

```
HOW TO MIX LOTS OF COLORS
─────────────────────────

OPTION 1: SAME SATURATION
├── All colors at same intensity
├── Example: All pastels, all jewel tones
└── United by "energy level"

OPTION 2: SAME VALUE (lightness)
├── All colors same light/dark level
├── Example: All deep/dark or all bright
└── United by "weight"

OPTION 3: ONE UNIFYING COLOR
├── One color appears in each element
├── Example: Gold thread through everything
└── United by "golden thread" (literal or figurative)

OPTION 4: PATTERN AS BRIDGE
├── One patterned element contains all colors
├── Use pattern as "source" for solid colors
└── Example: Colorful rug → pull wall, pillow, art colors from it
```

└── Moody lighting

Option C: Maximalist pattern clash
├── Different patterns on walls vs ceiling
├── Bold floor tile
├── Clashing but coordinated
└── "More is more" made literal
```

## Color + Metallics

```
WARM COLORS → WARM METALS
─────────────────────────
Red, orange, yellow, warm pink → Brass, gold, copper

COOL COLORS → COOL METALS
─────────────────────────
Blue, green, purple, cool pink → Silver, chrome, nickel

MAXIMALIST RULE:
Mix your metals! Brass AND chrome together is excellent.
The "don't mix metals" rule is for cowards.
```

## Paint Finish by Color

```
DARK COLORS
───────────
├── Eggshell or satin (not flat)
├── Flat dark walls show every scuff
├── Some sheen adds depth and richness
└── Consider lacquer for serious drama

BRIGHT/SATURATED COLORS
───────────────────────
├── Eggshell preferred
├── Satin can look plasticky
├── Matte is fine if quality paint
└── Touch-ups blend easier with flat/eggshell

CEILINGS IN COLOR
─────────────────
├── Flat/matte to avoid glare
├── Can go same or darker than walls
├── Don't forget the ceiling!
└── Fifth wall = fifth opportunity
```

## Testing Colors

```
BEFORE YOU COMMIT
─────────────────

1. Buy sample sizes (multiple colors)
2. Paint on large poster boards (not directly on wall)
3. Move boards around room throughout day
4. Live with samples for 2-3 days minimum
5. Check in morning light, afternoon light, and with lamps on

WHY POSTER BOARDS?
├── Can move them to different walls
├── Can compare multiple at once
├── No commitment
├── Can take to store for fabric/furniture matching
└── See color on YOUR wall's texture
```

**Remember**: There are no wrong colors, only wrong proportions. Be bold, trust your joy, and remember: you can always repaint.
