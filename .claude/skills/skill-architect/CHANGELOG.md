# Changelog: skill-architect

## v1.0.0 (2026-01-14)

### Created
- **Unified meta-skill** combining skill-coach and skill-creator
- Merged systematic workflow from skill-creator
- Merged domain expertise encoding from skill-coach
- Consolidated best practices from both skills

### Features
- 6-step skill creation process
- Shibboleth encoding (expert knowledge patterns)
- Anti-pattern catalog with case studies
- Self-contained tool implementation (scripts, MCP, subagents)
- Progressive disclosure design principles
- Activation debugging workflows
- Comprehensive validation checklists

### References Added

- `subagent-template.md` - Agent definition format

### Philosophy
"Great skills are progressive disclosure machines that encode real domain expertise, not just surface instructions."

### Replaces
- skill-coach (v2.x) - Expertise encoding focus
- skill-creator (v1.x) - Systematic workflow focus

### Migration
Users of skill-coach or skill-creator should switch to skill-architect for the unified experience.
