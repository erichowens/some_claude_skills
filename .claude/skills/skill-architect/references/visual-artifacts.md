# Visual Artifacts in Skills: Mermaid Diagrams & Code

Skills that include Mermaid diagrams serve two audiences simultaneously:

- **For humans reading docs**: Diagrams render as visual flowcharts, state machines, ER models, timelines. Structure is parsed at a glance.
- **For agents executing tasks**: Mermaid is a text-based graph DSL. `A -->|Yes| B` is an explicit, unambiguous directed edge. The agent reads the raw text and reasons over the graph structure directly — it never "sees" the rendered picture.

This dual utility is what makes Mermaid ideal for skills. Prose like "if the skill exists, audit it; otherwise create it" requires the agent to parse natural language for branching logic. The Mermaid equivalent — `A{Exists?} -->|Yes| B[Audit]` / `A -->|No| C[Create]` — encodes the same branching as an explicit graph the agent can traverse.

**Rule of thumb**: If a skill describes a process, decision tree, architecture, state machine, timeline, or data relationship, it should include a Mermaid diagram. The agent benefits from the formal structure; the human benefits from the visual rendering.

---

## Can Agents Actually Interpret Mermaid?

Yes. Mermaid is just text — a concise DSL for describing graphs, sequences, and relationships. When a skill contains:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A{Has tests?} -->|Yes| B[Safe to refactor]
  A -->|No| C[Write tests first]
```

The agent reads: node A is a decision ("Has tests?"), with a "Yes" edge to node B ("Safe to refactor") and a "No" edge to node C ("Write tests first"). This is actually **more precise** than equivalent prose, because:

1. **Edges are explicit** — prose can be ambiguous about which condition leads where
2. **Node types encode meaning** — `{diamond}` = decision, `[rectangle]` = action, `([stadium])` = start/end
3. **Structure is formal** — the graph topology is machine-readable
4. **Token cost is low** — the Mermaid above is ~30 tokens; prose equivalent is ~40 tokens

The tradeoff: Mermaid is slightly less natural to *write* than prose. But it's more precise to *consume*, for both agents and humans.

**When prose is better**: Explanatory context, rationale, nuance, caveats. "Use X because Y" is better as a sentence. "If X then A, if Y then B" is better as a flowchart.

## Why Mermaid Over Other Formats

| Medium | Tokens | Agent-parseable | Human-readable | Version-controllable |
|--------|--------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Prose paragraph | ~200 | Ambiguous branching | Familiar but slow | Yes but hard to diff |
| Markdown table | ~80 | Good for comparisons | Fast scan | Yes |
| Mermaid diagram | ~60 | Explicit graph structure | Instant visual | Yes, text-based |
| ASCII art | ~150 | Fragile, misaligned | Breaks on re-flow | Painful to maintain |

**Prefer Mermaid over ASCII art.** Mermaid is semantic (explicit nodes and edges); ASCII art is visual layout that breaks on re-flow and is harder for agents to parse reliably.

---

## Raw Mermaid vs. Quoted Mermaid

**In SKILL.md (skill's own content)**: Use raw ` ```mermaid ` blocks. These are the skill's actual diagrams — the agent reads them directly, and humans see rendered versions.

**In reference docs (showing how to write Mermaid)**: Use ` ````markdown ` outer fences to wrap ` ```mermaid ` examples. This is meta-documentation — examples of what to write, not diagrams to interpret.

**Never**: Wrap a skill's own decision tree in a `````markdown` fence. That turns it from "follow this logic" into "here's an example of a diagram" — the agent treats quoted content as illustrative, not operative.

---

## Mermaid YAML Frontmatter Configuration (Optional)

Mermaid diagrams can optionally include a YAML frontmatter block (delimited by `---`) before the diagram definition. **This is purely for rendering customization** — themes, colors, spacing. Agents ignore it. Renderers apply sensible defaults without it.

**When to use frontmatter**: Published documentation where visual consistency matters.
**When to skip it**: Skills, reference files, agent-consumed content. Plain Mermaid is cleaner and lower-token.

### Basic Structure

````markdown
```mermaid
---
title: My Diagram Title
config:
  theme: default
  themeVariables:
    primaryColor: "#4a86c8"
---
flowchart LR
  A[Start] --> B[End]
```
````

### Theme Options

| Theme | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| `default` | General purpose, clean look |
| `dark` | Dark-mode environments |
| `forest` | Green-toned, organic feel |
| `neutral` | Minimal, grayscale |
| `base` | Starting point for full customization via `themeVariables` |

### Common `themeVariables`

```yaml
config:
  themeVariables:
    primaryColor: "#4a86c8"        # Main node fill
    primaryTextColor: "#fff"       # Text on primary nodes
    primaryBorderColor: "#3a76b8"  # Border of primary nodes
    secondaryColor: "#f4f4f4"      # Secondary node fill
    tertiaryColor: "#e8e8e8"       # Tertiary node fill
    lineColor: "#333"              # Edge/arrow color
    fontSize: "16px"               # Base font size
    fontFamily: "monospace"        # Font family
    background: "#ffffff"          # Diagram background
    nodeBorder: "#333"             # Default node border
    noteTextColor: "#333"          # Note text color
    noteBkgColor: "#fff5ad"        # Note background
    edgeLabelBackground: "#fff"    # Edge label background
```

### Per-Diagram Configuration

The `config` block can include diagram-specific keys:

```yaml
---
config:
  flowchart:
    htmlLabels: true
    curve: basis           # basis, linear, stepBefore, stepAfter
    padding: 15
    nodeSpacing: 50
    rankSpacing: 50
    defaultRenderer: dagre  # dagre or elk
  sequence:
    mirrorActors: false
    bottomMarginAdj: 1
    actorFontSize: 14
    noteFontSize: 12
    messageFontSize: 14
    diagramMarginX: 50
    diagramMarginY: 10
    useMaxWidth: true
  gantt:
    titleTopMargin: 25
    barHeight: 20
    barGap: 4
    topPadding: 50
    sectionFontSize: 16
  er:
    layoutDirection: TB    # TB or LR
    minEntityWidth: 100
    minEntityHeight: 75
    entityPadding: 15
    fontSize: 12

## Diagram Type Catalog

Mermaid supports a rich taxonomy of diagram types. Choose based on what you're modeling.

### Flowchart / Graph — Decision Trees & Processes

**Use when**: A skill encodes a decision tree, troubleshooting flowchart, or branching process.

**This is the most common diagram type for skills** — most skills have some "If X then A, if Y then B" logic that belongs in a flowchart.

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[User asks to create skill] --> B{Existing skill?}
  B -->|Yes| C[Audit & Improve]
  B -->|No| D[Gather 3-5 examples]
  D --> E[Plan reusable contents]
  E --> F[Initialize skill folder]
  F --> G[Write scripts → refs → SKILL.md]
  G --> H[Validate]
  H --> I{Errors?}
  I -->|Yes| G
  I -->|No| J[Ship it]
```
````

**Direction options**: `TD` (top-down), `LR` (left-right), `BT` (bottom-top), `RL` (right-left)

**Node shapes**:
- `[text]` — rectangle
- `(text)` — rounded rectangle
- `{text}` — diamond (decision)
- `([text])` — stadium/pill

mindmap
  root((Skill Architecture))
    Metadata Layer
      name
      description
      allowed-tools
    SKILL.md Layer
      Decision trees
      Anti-patterns
      Reference index
    Reference Layer
      Domain guides

- Automatic layout based on indentation
- Icon support with `::icon(fa fa-book)`

---

### Timeline — Historical / Temporal Knowledge

**Use when**: A skill encodes temporal knowledge (framework evolution, API deprecations, "what changed when").

````markdown
```mermaid
timeline
  title React State Management Evolution
  2015 : Redux released
       : Became default for global state
  2019 : Context API improved (React 16.3)
       : Hooks introduced (React 16.8)
  2020 : Zustand released
       : Jotai released
  2023 : React Server Components stable
       : Server state moves to server
  2024 : Redux only for time-travel debugging
       : Most apps use Zustand or React Query
```
````

This is particularly valuable for **shibboleth encoding** — the temporal evolution that LLMs get wrong.

---

### Pie Chart — Proportions & Distributions

**Use when**: Showing relative sizes, coverage breakdowns, or category distributions.

````markdown
```mermaid
pie title Skill Token Budget

````markdown
```mermaid
quadrantChart
  title Skill Improvement Priority
  x-axis Low Effort --> High Effort
  y-axis Low Impact --> High Impact
  quadrant-1 Do First
  quadrant-2 Plan Carefully
  quadrant-3 Delegate or Skip
  quadrant-4 Quick Wins
  Add NOT clause: [0.2, 0.8]
  Tighten description: [0.3, 0.9]

  commit id: "Add prompt structure"
  checkout main
  merge feature/subagent-design id: "v2.0.0"
```
````

---

### Class Diagram — Object Models & Type Hierarchies

**Use when**: A skill involves type systems, class hierarchies, interfaces, or any OO/structural modeling.

  }
  Skill "1" --> "*" Reference : contains
  Skill "1" --> "*" Script : bundles
  Skill <|-- MetaSkill : extends
```
````

---

### User Journey — Experience Mapping

**Use when**: A skill models a user flow, onboarding experience, or multi-step interaction.

````markdown
```mermaid
journey
  title First-Time Skill User
  section Discovery
    Find skill in catalog: 3: User
    Read description: 4: User
    Skill activates on query: 5: System

    Consult references: 3: User
    Customize for project: 4: User
    Contribute improvements: 5: User
```
````

Scores are satisfaction ratings (1-5). Actors are labeled after the colon.

---

### Sankey Diagram — Flow Quantities

## Best Practices for Mermaid in Skills

### 1. Put Diagrams in the Right Layer

- **SKILL.md**: Include 1-3 key diagrams (decision trees, core workflow). These are loaded on activation and should be high-value, low-token.
- **References**: Include detailed diagrams (full ER models, comprehensive state machines, architecture layouts). These are loaded on demand.
- **Never**: Overload SKILL.md with 10 diagrams. That defeats progressive disclosure.

### 2. Use Mermaid for Decision Trees Instead of Prose

**Bad (prose)**:
> "First check if the skill exists. If it does, audit it. If not, gather examples, then plan contents, then initialize, then write, then validate."

**Good (flowchart)**:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A{Skill exists?} -->|Yes| B[Audit & Improve]
  A -->|No| C[Gather examples]
  C --> D[Plan contents]
  D --> E[Initialize]
  E --> F[Write]
  F --> G[Validate]
```

The flowchart is ~40 tokens. The prose is ~35 tokens. For a human, the flowchart is instantly parseable. For an agent, the flowchart encodes explicit branching structure (`-->|Yes|`, `-->|No|`) that prose leaves ambiguous. Both audiences benefit; neither is disadvantaged.

### 3. Prefer Specific Diagram Types Over Generic Flowcharts

A sequence diagram for protocol interactions is more informative than a flowchart of the same protocol. A state diagram for lifecycle management is clearer than a flowchart with "go back to step 2" arrows. Choose the diagram type that matches the underlying structure.

### 4. Skip YAML Frontmatter Unless Publishing

YAML frontmatter in Mermaid is for rendering customization only — themes, colors, spacing. **Agents don't use it. Renderers apply defaults without it.** Only add frontmatter when you're publishing polished documentation and need visual consistency across multiple diagrams.

For skills and references, plain Mermaid is cleaner and costs fewer tokens:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A --> B
```

If you do need it (e.g., for a published site), the syntax is a `---` block before the diagram type. See the Configuration section above for all options.

### 5. Use Raw Mermaid, Not Quoted Mermaid

In SKILL.md and references, use raw ` ```mermaid ` blocks — these are content the agent should interpret and act on. Only use outer ` ````markdown ` fences in documentation *about* Mermaid (like this file), where the example is illustrative, not operative.

### 6. Keep Diagrams Self-Contained

Each diagram should be understandable without reading the surrounding prose. Use descriptive node labels, not cryptic abbreviations:

- ✅ `A[Check description has NOT clause]`
- ❌ `A[Step 2.3]`

### 7. Code Blocks Are Visual Artifacts Too

Don't neglect inline code examples as visual artifacts. A 5-line code snippet is worth 50 words of description:

```yaml
# Good: concrete, copy-pasteable
description: CLIP semantic search for image-text matching.
  NOT for counting, spatial reasoning, or generation.
```

> Bad: "Write a description that mentions what the skill does, when it should be used, and includes a NOT clause with things it should not be used for."

---

## Encouraging Visual Artifacts in Skills You Create

When creating or auditing a skill, ask:

1. **Does this skill have a decision tree?** → Render it as a flowchart
2. **Does it describe a multi-step protocol?** → Render it as a sequence diagram
3. **Does it manage states/lifecycle?** → Render it as a state diagram
4. **Does it encode temporal knowledge?** → Render it as a timeline
5. **Does it model data relationships?** → Render it as an ER diagram
6. **Does it prioritize options on two axes?** → Render it as a quadrant chart
7. **Does it describe system architecture?** → Render it as a block/architecture diagram

If the answer to any of these is "yes" and the skill only uses prose, **that's an improvement opportunity**.
