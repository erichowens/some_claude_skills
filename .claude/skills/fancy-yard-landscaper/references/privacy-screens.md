# Privacy Screen Plant Guide

## The Real Talk on Fast-Growing Privacy

### The Hard Truth

```
WHAT PEOPLE WANT:
├── Instant privacy (plant today, hidden tomorrow)
├── Low maintenance (plant and forget)
├── Evergreen (green all year)
├── Cheap (spend little, get lot)
├── Beautiful (magazine-worthy)
└── Lives forever

REALITY:
├── Fast growth = weak wood, short life
├── Low maintenance = more maintenance than expected
├── Evergreen options have trade-offs
├── Cheap plants often fail
├── Beautiful takes time and care
└── Everything dies eventually

THE REAL FORMULA:
Good privacy = Time + Right Plant + Proper Spacing + Patience
```

## The Arborvitae Problem (Read This First)

### Why Everyone Buys Them

```
ARBORVITAE APPEAL:
├── Evergreen (check)
├── Affordable at nursery (check)
├── "Fast growing" on label (check)
├── Columnar shape (perfect for screens)
└── Available everywhere (check)

THEN REALITY HITS...
```

### What Nobody Tells You

```
ARBORVITAE PROBLEMS
───────────────────

1. DEER DEVASTATION
   ├── Deer find arborvitae delicious
   ├── Will eat to bare sticks in one winter
   ├── Especially 'Emerald Green' (deer candy)
   ├── Once damaged, often never recovers
   └── Deer pressure varies by region, but be warned

2. BAGWORM INFESTATION
   ├── Small moth larvae that build "bags" on branches
   ├── Can kill entire hedge in 1-2 seasons
   ├── Hard to spot until damage is severe
   ├── Spreads rapidly through dense plantings
   └── Chemical treatment needed

3. SNOW/ICE DAMAGE
   ├── Heavy snow bends and breaks branches
   ├── Ice storms devastating to columnar forms
   ├── Once bent, rarely returns to shape
   ├── May need wrapping in winter (who wants that?)
   └── 'Emerald Green' especially vulnerable

4. BROWNING FROM INSIDE
   ├── Normal shedding looks alarming
   ├── But also indicates stress
   ├── Drought stress shows as browning
   ├── Spider mites cause bronze discoloration
   └── Hard to tell normal from problem

5. ROOT PROBLEMS
   ├── Shallow root system
   ├── Prone to blowing over in wind
   ├── Circling roots from nursery pots
   ├── Root-bound stock often fails
   └── Needs good drainage (rots in wet soil)

6. SLOW TO ESTABLISH
   ├── "Fast growing" = 6-12" per year
   ├── Takes 3-5 years to provide real privacy
   ├── First year or two: mostly rooting
   └── Don't expect instant gratification
```

### Arborvitae Variety Breakdown

| Variety | Mature Height | Growth Rate | Deer Resistance | Cold Hardy | Best For |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|----------|
| 'Emerald Green' | 12-15' | 6-9"/yr | LOW (eaten) | Zone 4-8 | Small spaces, IF no deer |
| 'Green Giant' | 40-60' | 3-4'/yr | MEDIUM | Zone 5-9 | Large properties |
| 'North Pole' | 10-15' | 6-9"/yr | LOW | Zone 3-7 | Cold climates |
| 'Techny' | 10-15' | 12"/yr | MEDIUM | Zone 3-8 | Midwest/cold areas |
| 'American' (wild type) | 40-60' | 12-18"/yr | LOW | Zone 2-7 | Native, large spaces |

### The Verdict

```
PLANT ARBORVITAE IF:
├── You're in a low-deer area (confirm with neighbors)
├── You're willing to monitor for bagworms
├── You can wrap them in winter OR accept some damage
├── You have patience for 3-5 year establishment
└── You have backup plan if they fail

DON'T PLANT ARBORVITAE IF:
├── You've seen deer in your neighborhood
├── You want truly low maintenance
├── Heavy snow/ice is common
├── You need privacy in under 3 years
└── You can't handle watching them struggle
```

## Better Alternatives

### The Privacy All-Stars

```

───────────────────────────────────────────────

NORWAY SPRUCE (Picea abies)
───────────────────────────
├── Evergreen conifer
├── Deer resistant

└── Needs room! Gets wide.

SPACING: 10-15' apart (they get BIG)
COST: $-$$
VERDICT: Beautiful, reliable, but give them space
```

### For Smaller Spaces

```
COMPACT OPTIONS (under 15' mature height)
─────────────────────────────────────────

'Green Mountain' Boxwood - 5' tall, very formal
Sky Pencil Holly - 10' tall, only 2' wide (columnar)
Emerald Green Arborvitae - IF deer aren't an issue
Spartan Juniper - 15' tall, 5' wide, very columnar
Wax Myrtle - 12-15' tall, semi-evergreen South
```

## Spacing Formula

### How Far Apart?

```
SPACING FORMULA
───────────────

For a dense hedge:
Plant at 60-70% of mature width

For a natural screen:
Plant at 80-90% of mature width

EXAMPLE:
Nellie Stevens Holly: 10' mature width
├── Dense hedge: 6-7' spacing
└── Natural screen: 8-9' spacing

COMMON MISTAKES:
├── Planting too close (looks good now, disaster in 5 years)
├── Using immature width (3-gallon plant width, not mature)
├── Not accounting for snow load spread
└── Expecting mature width overnight
```

### Time to Privacy Calculator

```
TIME TO SOLID SCREEN
────────────────────

Current height → Target height ÷ Annual growth = Years

EXAMPLE:
Buying 6' tall Nellie Stevens Holly
Want 12' screen
Growth rate: 2.5'/year

12' - 6' = 6' needed
6' ÷ 2.5'/year = 2.4 years to height

BUT add 1 year for establishment/filling in = 3.4 years

REALITY: Plan for 3-5 years for most privacy screens
```

## Maintenance Reality

### Year 1

```
YEAR 1: ESTABLISHMENT
─────────────────────
├── Water 1" per week (more in heat)
├── Mulch 2-3" deep (not touching trunk)
├── NO fertilizer first year (focus on roots)
├── Monitor for stress (wilting, browning)
├── Stake only if necessary
├── Protect from deer if applicable
└── DO NOT expect much top growth

WATER SCHEDULE:
├── Spring: Weekly deep watering
├── Summer: Twice weekly in heat
├── Fall: Weekly until ground freezes
└── Even evergreens need winter water (dry winters)
```

### Ongoing Care

```
ANNUAL MAINTENANCE
──────────────────

SPRING:
├── Fertilize with slow-release balanced fertilizer
├── Check for winter damage, prune out
├── Monitor for bagworms (starting in May)
├── Refresh mulch

SUMMER:
├── Deep water during drought
├── Treat bagworms if found (Bt or spinosad)
├── Monitor for spider mites (bronze color)
└── Light pruning if needed for shape

FALL:
├── Deep watering before freeze
├── Wrap columnar evergreens if in snow country
├── Deer repellent application
└── No late fertilizing

WINTER:
├── Brush off heavy snow (gently!)
├── Don't salt near evergreens
├── Water during dry spells (yes, in winter)
└── Inspect for animal damage
```

## Regional Recommendations

### By Climate Zone

```
ZONES 3-4 (Very Cold)
─────────────────────
Best: Norway Spruce, Eastern Red Cedar, Techny Arborvitae
Avoid: Skip Laurel, Nellie Stevens, Leyland Cypress
Trick: Mix evergreens with deciduous (birch, serviceberry)

ZONES 5-6 (Transitional)
────────────────────────
Best: Everything works if deer-resistant
Avoid: Southern broadleafs in cold pockets
Trick: Site on north/east side of buildings for protection

ZONES 7-8 (Moderate)
────────────────────
Best: Skip Laurel, Nellie Stevens, Cryptomeria
Avoid: Plants that need cold (some spruces struggle)
Trick: Summer drought bigger issue than winter cold

ZONES 9+ (Warm)
───────────────
Best: Wax Myrtle, Podocarpus, Clusia, Viburnum
Avoid: Northern conifers (arborvitae, spruce)
Trick: Many tropical options available
```

## The Smart Strategy

```
IF I HAD TO DO IT OVER
──────────────────────

1. FENCE FIRST (if feasible)
   ├── Provides immediate privacy
   ├── Plants soften it over time
   └── Plants can be smaller/cheaper

2. MIX SPECIES
   ├── Don't monoculture (all one plant = all vulnerable)
   ├── 2-3 compatible species
   └── Stagger heights for layered effect

3. BUY SMALLER
   ├── 4-6' plants establish faster than 8-10'
   ├── Catch up within 3 years
   └── Much cheaper
   └── Less transplant shock

4. NATIVE IS WISE
   ├── Already adapted to your conditions
   ├── Wildlife benefits
   └── Often cheaper from conservation programs

5. PATIENCE
   ├── The best privacy screens are planted 10 years ago
   ├── Second best time: this fall
   └── Think in decades, not months
```

---

**Final thought**: Fast privacy usually means fast problems. The plants that grow 5+ feet per year are also the plants that have weak wood, disease susceptibility, and short lifespans. Plant for 20 years from now, not 2 years from now. Your future self will thank you.
