## Infrastructure Requirements

### Cloud Resources Needed

| Resource | Purpose | Status | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| PostgreSQL DB | Primary data | Unknown | Verify or create |
| Redis | Caching | Unknown | Verify or create |
| S3 Bucket | File storage | Unknown | Verify or create |

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Redis 7+

# Setup steps
1. Clone all repos
2. Copy .env.example files
3. Start infrastructure (docker-compose)
4. Install dependencies
5. Run migrations
6. Seed data (if available)
7. Start services
```

---

## Resurrection Order

Based on dependencies, resurrect in this order:

```
Phase 1: Infrastructure
├── Set up local databases
├── Configure environment variables
└── Verify cloud access

Phase 2: Foundation
├── repo-shared-lib (no dependencies)
├── repo-database (migrations)
└── repo-auth (minimal deps)

Phase 3: Core Services
├── repo-api (depends on auth, db)
└── repo-workers (depends on api)

Phase 4: User Facing
├── repo-frontend (depends on api)
└── repo-mobile (depends on api)

Phase 5: Integration
├── End-to-end testing
└── Full system verification
```

---

## Integration Tests

### Resurrection Verification Tests

These tests verify each phase of resurrection:

#### Phase 1 Tests: Infrastructure
- [ ] Can connect to PostgreSQL
- [ ] Can connect to Redis
- [ ] Can access S3 bucket
- [ ] Environment variables loaded correctly

#### Phase 2 Tests: Foundation
- [ ] Shared library imports work
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Auth service starts
- [ ] Auth service responds to health check

#### Phase 3 Tests: Core Services
- [ ] API service starts
- [ ] API service connects to database
- [ ] API service connects to auth
- [ ] Worker service starts
- [ ] Worker service processes test job

#### Phase 4 Tests: User Facing
- [ ] Frontend builds successfully
- [ ] Frontend loads in browser
- [ ] Frontend can authenticate
- [ ] Basic user flow works

#### Phase 5 Tests: Integration
- [ ] Full user signup flow
- [ ] Full user login flow
- [ ] Core feature #1 works
- [ ] Core feature #2 works

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

1. **[Risk]**: [Description]
   - Mitigation: [Plan]
   - Fallback: [Alternative if mitigation fails]

### Data Concerns

- [ ] Old database needs migration
- [ ] User data needs to be preserved
- [ ] PII handling compliance

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Tasks | Effort Range |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Infrastructure | 5 | Low-Medium |
| Phase 2: Foundation | 8 | Medium |
| Phase 3: Core | 12 | Medium-High |
| Phase 4: User Facing | 6 | Medium |
| Phase 5: Integration | 4 | Medium |
| **Total** | **35** | **Medium-High** |

*Note: Estimates assume minimal unexpected blockers*

---

## Success Criteria

The system is considered "resurrected" when:

- [ ] All services start without errors
- [ ] Services can communicate with each other
- [ ] Database connections work
- [ ] Authentication works end-to-end
- [ ] At least one core user flow works
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] A user can [primary use case]

---

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Obtain/renew required credentials
2. [ ] Set up development infrastructure
3. [ ] Begin Phase 1 resurrection
4. [ ] Document any additional blockers found
5. [ ] Update this plan as needed
