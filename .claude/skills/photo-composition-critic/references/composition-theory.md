# Composition Theory

Graduate-level visual aesthetics foundations.

## Visual Weight & Balance (Arnheim, 1974)

```
VISUAL WEIGHT FACTORS
├── Size: Larger = heavier
├── Color: Warm/saturated = heavier than cool/desaturated
├── Isolation: Isolated elements carry more weight
├── Intrinsic Interest: Faces, text, unusual shapes
├── Position: Upper-right carries more weight (Western reading)
└── Depth: Objects appearing closer = heavier

BALANCE TYPES
├── Symmetrical: Formal, stable, static
├── Asymmetrical: Dynamic, interesting, requires skill
├── Radial: Energy emanating from center
└── Crystallographic: All-over pattern (Pollock)
```

## Gestalt Principles in Photography

```
PROXIMITY: Elements near each other = grouped
SIMILARITY: Similar elements = related
CONTINUITY: Eye follows lines/curves
CLOSURE: Brain completes incomplete shapes
FIGURE-GROUND: Subject/background separation
PRÄGNANZ: Simplest interpretation preferred
```

## Dynamic Symmetry (Hambidge)

Beyond golden ratio - the full system:

```
ROOT RECTANGLES
├── √2 (1:1.414) - A-series paper, dynamic diagonal
├── √3 (1:1.732) - Hexagonal harmony
├── √4 (1:2) - Double square, panoramic
├── √5 (1:2.236) - Contains golden ratio
└── φ (1:1.618) - Golden rectangle

CONSTRUCTION
├── Diagonal from corner to corner
├── Reciprocal from corner to opposite diagonal
├── Intersection points = "eyes" of the rectangle
└── Baroque/Sinister diagonals (left-rising vs right-rising)
```

## The Arabesque (Harold Speed)

The continuous line that leads the eye through the composition.

```
TYPES
├── S-curve (Hogarth's "Line of Beauty")
├── Spiral (nautilus, cochlea)
├── Diagonal thrust
├── Circular containment
└── Zigzag energy

QUALITY METRICS
├── Does it enter the frame naturally?
├── Does it touch key subjects?
├── Does it avoid exits (corners, edges)?
└── Does it create rhythm through variation?
```
