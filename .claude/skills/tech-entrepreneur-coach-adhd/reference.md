**The Anti-Burnout System**:

```
BOUNDARIES (Sacred)

Work hours: 10am - 4pm (max 6 hours deep work)
No work: Evenings, weekends (seriously)
Exercise: Daily (non-negotiable, ADHD regulation)
Sleep: 7-8 hours (your brain needs it)

Revenue goals:
- $5K/month = sustainable
- $10K/month = comfortable
- $20K/month = thriving

Don't optimize beyond $20K MRR unless you WANT to scale.
More money ≠ more happiness with ADHD.
```

## Common Big Tech → Indie Challenges

### Challenge 1: "I Don't Know What to Build"

**Big Tech Mindset**: "We need user research, market analysis, competitive landscape..."

**Indie Reality**: 
```
Build something YOU need.
Ex-FAANG engineers have problems worth solving:
- Tools for managing ADHD productivity
- ML workflow automation
- Code review assistants
- Time tracking for consultants
- Portfolio/resume builders for tech
- Interview prep platforms

You are the target audience.
Build for yourself, charge others like you.
```

### Challenge 2: "I Can't Do Marketing/Sales"

**Big Tech Mindset**: "We have marketing teams for this"

**Indie Reality**:
```
You don't need to "do marketing."
You need to have conversations.

Script:
"I built [thing] because I had [problem].
 Does this resonate with you?"

If yes: "Want to try it?"
If no: "What would make it useful?"

That's it. Repeat 100 times.
You'll get good at it.
```

**ADHD Hack**: 
Frame it as "user research" not "sales"
Your brain likes solving problems (research)
Your brain hates "selling" (feels icky)
→ Reframe and it becomes doable

### Challenge 3: "I Keep Starting New Projects"

**Big Tech Mindset**: N/A (you only worked on one thing at a time)

**Indie Reality**:
```
This is the #1 ADHD killer of indie success.

The Rule: ONE project in "launch" phase at a time.

Allowed:
✅ Maintain existing profitable app
✅ Work on ONE new app
✅ Take notes on future ideas

Not allowed:
❌ Work on multiple pre-launch projects
❌ Rebuild existing app from scratch
❌ Start "just a quick experiment" (lies)

Use "Idea Backlog" (Notion):
- When new idea hits: Write it down
- Set reminder: Review in 1 month
- Most ideas won't survive 30 days
- The ones that do = worth building
```

### Challenge 4: "I'm Running Out of Money"

**Big Tech Mindset**: $300K+ salary, no money worries

**Indie Reality**:
```
Runway Planning (Critical)

Calculate:
- Monthly expenses: $X
- Current savings: $Y
- Runway: Y / X months

If runway < 6 months:
URGENT: Get to first dollar FAST
- Simplify MVP (1 week to launch)
- Freelance 2 days/week for cash ($200-300/hour ML consulting)
- Live on minimal expenses

If runway 6-12 months:
FOCUSED: Execute the plan
- 2-week MVP
- 1 month to $1K MRR
- 3 months to $5K MRR

If runway > 12 months:
STRATEGIC: Take time to validate
- Test multiple ideas
- Build audience first
- Choose best opportunity

Don't let runway hit zero.
At 3 months: Get freelance income or pivot.
```

### Challenge 5: "Impostor Syndrome"

**Big Tech Mindset**: "I'm just a Google engineer, why would anyone buy from me?"

**Indie Reality**:
```
You have MASSIVE advantages:

1. Technical Depth
   Most indie hackers can't build what you can.
   Your "basic" = someone else's "impossible"

2. Big Tech Credential
   "Ex-Google ML Engineer" = instant credibility
   Use it in bio, landing page, marketing

3. Problem-Solving
   You debugged distributed systems at scale.
   A small business problem? Easy mode.

4. AI Native
   You understand LLMs better than 99% of people.
   This is unfair advantage in 2024+

Your impostor syndrome is lying.
You're more qualified than you think.
```

If business is up but ADHD health is down:
→ Unsustainable. Adjust immediately.

If both are down:
→ Take a break. Go outside. Reset.

If both are up:
→ You've found the sweet spot. Maintain.
```

## Real Talk: ADHD + Entrepreneurship

### What Makes It Harder

❌ No external structure (meetings, deadlines)
❌ No team to catch your mistakes
❌ Decision fatigue (you decide EVERYTHING)
❌ Inconsistent income (ADHD hates uncertainty)
❌ Easy to doom-scroll instead of work
❌ Rejection sensitivity (product criticism hurts)

### What Makes It Easier

✅ Work when hyperfocus strikes (2am? Fine!)
✅ No boring meetings
✅ Only work on interesting problems
✅ Direct feedback (revenue = validation)
✅ Dopamine from shipping + earning
✅ Control your environment completely

### The Honest Assessment

```
Entrepreneurship is NOT for everyone with ADHD.

You'll thrive if:
✓ You have high frustration tolerance
✓ You can handle rejection
✓ You're okay with uncertainty
✓ You have support system (partner, friends)
✓ You're willing to do boring tasks sometimes
✓ You can recognize when to quit

You'll struggle if:
✗ You need external validation constantly
✗ You can't handle financial stress
✗ You abandon projects at first obstacle
✗ You won't do any marketing/sales
✗ You need immediate results (patience required)

Be honest with yourself.
There's no shame in going back to W2.
```

## Emergency Protocols

### When You're Stuck (The 3-Day Rule)

```
If you haven't made progress in 3 days:

Day 1: Acknowledge you're stuck
       Don't shame yourself. It happens.

Day 2: Talk to someone
       DM another indie hacker
       Post in community: "I'm stuck on X. Help?"
       
Day 3: Change something
       New location (coffee shop)
       Different task (skip to easier thing)
       Ask for help (hire contractor for $100 to unblock)

If still stuck after 3 days:
→ The scope is too big. Cut features.
→ Or the idea isn't exciting anymore. Okay to pivot.
```

### When You Want to Quit

```
Before quitting, ask:

1. Is this a bad idea or am I just tired?
   (If tired: Take a week off. Revisit after.)

2. Have I given it a fair shot?
   (Fair shot = 3 months of consistent effort)

3. Is there any traction?
   (Even 5 happy users = signal)

4. What would I do instead?
   (If answer is "go back to FAANG": Maybe take a break first)

It's okay to quit.
Sunk cost fallacy is real.
But make sure you're quitting the right thing
for the right reasons.
```

## Success Stories (Pattern Recognition)

What successful ex-FAANG indie makers with ADHD have in common:

1. **Scratched their own itch** (didn't chase markets)
2. **Shipped fast and ugly** (perfection came later)
3. **Focused on ONE thing** (resisted shiny objects)
4. **Built in public** (accountability + audience)
5. **Charged from day 1** (validated with revenue)
6. **Automated ruthlessly** (focused on creative work)
7. **Maintained boundaries** (avoided burnout)
8. **Used AI aggressively** (10x productivity multiplier)

## Your 90-Day Plan

```
Month 1: Build & Launch
- Week 1: Pick idea (use framework)
- Week 2-3: Build MVP
- Week 4: Launch, get first customer

Month 2: Growth
- Weeks 5-8: Daily marketing (one channel)
- Goal: $1K MRR
- Metrics: Track daily active users, conversion

Month 3: Refinement
- Weeks 9-12: Improve retention
- Goal: $3K MRR
- Decision: Scale or start next project

If at $3K+ MRR by Day 90:
→ You've validated. Keep going.

If at $0 MRR by Day 90:
→ Honest assessment. Pivot or get freelance work.

If at $500-$1K MRR by Day 90:
→ Promising. Give it another 90 days.
```

## Remember

You're not broken. You're differently wired.

Your ADHD gives you:
- Hyperfocus superpowers
- Creative problem-solving
- Tolerance for chaos
- Rapid learning ability
- Thinking outside the box

Your big tech experience gives you:
- World-class technical skills
- System thinking
- Ability to learn anything fast
- Credibility and network
- Understanding of scale

Combined = Unfair advantage.

Now go build something people will pay for.

---

**Final advice**: Start before you're ready. Ship before it's perfect. Charge before you feel worthy. You've got this. 🚀

*P.S. - When you hit $5K MRR, treat yourself to something nice. You've earned it.*
