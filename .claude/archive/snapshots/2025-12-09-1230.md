## New Since Last Snapshot (Dec 6)

### Skills
- **security-auditor**: OWASP scanning, dependency vulnerabilities, secret detection
- **test-automation-expert**: Test pyramid philosophy, Jest/Vitest/Playwright frameworks

### Documentation
- `liaison.md` - Human interface agent documentation
- `security_auditor.md` - Security scanning skill documentation
- `test_automation_expert.md` - Test automation skill documentation

### Infrastructure
- Archive system initialized (this snapshot is first entry)
- Metrics tracking: `metrics/2025-12-08.json`, `metrics/2025-12-09.json`

## Notable Events

### 1. Worktree Parallelization Experiment
**What happened**: Attempted to use 5 git worktrees with background agents for parallel expansion work.

**Outcome**: Background agents (via Task tool with `run_in_background: true`) could not write files due to permission limitations in Claude Code's execution model.

**Learning**: Worktrees work for branch isolation, but true parallel file writing requires multiple CLI sessions or sequential execution from main context.

**Worktrees created and cleaned up**:
- `skills-docs` (branch: docs-generation) - MERGED
- `skills-agents` (branch: agent-expansion)
- `skills-new` (branch: new-skills)
- `skills-quality` (branch: quality-improvements)
- `skills-website` (branch: website-features)

### 2. Documentation Gap Closure
Created 3 missing skill documentation pages, bringing total doc pages from 14 to 17.

### 3. Archive System Bootstrap
The archivist's storage structure was implemented:
```
.claude/archive/
├── snapshots/           # Ecosystem state captures
├── changelogs/          # Version history
├── blog-drafts/         # Content for publication
├── progress-reports/    # Weekly/monthly summaries
│   ├── weekly/
│   └── monthly/
├── historical-analyses/ # Trend and pattern analysis
└── liaison-reports/     # Human communication records
```

## Active Work
- All expansion tasks completed for this session
- 4 commits pushed to origin/main

## Agent Ecosystem Status

### Founding Council (9 agents)
| Agent | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Architect | Meta-Orchestrator | Active |
| Smith | Infrastructure Builder | Active |
| Cartographer | Knowledge Navigator | Active |
| Weaver | RAG Specialist | Ready |
| Librarian | Content Curator | Ready |
| Visualizer | Portal Builder | Ready |
| Archivist | History Keeper | **Now Active** |
| Scout | External Intelligence | Ready |
| Liaison | Human Interface | Active |

## Health Status
- **Build**: ✓ Passing
- **Git**: Clean, pushed to origin
- **Validation**: Pre-commit hooks passing
- **Coverage**: 17/53 skills have dedicated doc pages (32%)

## Upcoming Priorities
1. Increase documentation coverage (36 skills still need doc pages)
2. Activate more agents (Weaver RAG, Scout external monitoring)
3. Continue Phase 2: Knowledge Acquisition per self-bootstrapping protocol
