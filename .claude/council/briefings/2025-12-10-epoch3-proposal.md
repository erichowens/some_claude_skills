**Status**: PROPOSAL FOR APPROVAL
**Council Members**: Architect, Archivist, Cartographer, Liaison, Librarian, Scout, Smith, Visualizer, Weaver

## 📊 Epoch 2 Final Assessment

| Workstream | Target | Achieved | Status |
|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| Documentation | 100% (53/53) | 53/53 | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| RAG Infrastructure | Semantic search | 1371 chunks, 50-60% similarity | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| Forge Scripts | 4 tools | 3 tools (validator, analyzer, benchmark) | ⚠️ 75% |
| External Intel | 3 reports | 1 report (HuggingFace) | ⚠️ 33% |
| Website Components | 3 interactive | 0 components | ❌ 0% |

**Epoch 2 Velocity**: 70% of targets achieved
**Key Wins**: RAG now functional with real embeddings, 100% doc coverage

## 🎯 Epoch 3 Priorities

### Option A: "Visibility First" (Recommended)
**Focus**: Make the ecosystem visible and inspectable to humans

1. **Website Interactive Components** (Visualizer-led)
   - D3.js capability graph showing agent/skill relationships
   - Skill comparison tool (side-by-side feature comparison)
   - Council activity timeline (epoch history, decision log)
   - Skill search powered by RAG API

2. **Council Transparency Portal**
   - Real-time ecosystem state dashboard
   - Epoch progress tracker
   - Agent activation history

3. **Finish Epoch 2 Carry-Overs**
   - Integration test generator (Smith)
   - GitHub/Twitter scout reports (Scout)

**Rationale**: User explicitly asked "Can I see all the progress and council/epoch notes yet?" - this directly addresses that need.

---

### Option B: "Agent Activation"
**Focus**: Bring more agents online for parallel work

1. **Activate Background Agents**
   - Run Scout in continuous mode for external intel
   - Run Librarian for content curation
   - Run Visualizer for dashboard updates

2. **Create Agent Coordination Protocol**
   - Shared file system conventions
   - Output format contracts
   - Conflict resolution rules

3. **Build Agent Monitoring**
   - Activity logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource tracking

**Rationale**: More agents = faster expansion, but requires coordination infrastructure

---

### Option C: "Tool Expansion"
**Focus**: Create new MCP servers and utilities

1. **Skill MCP Server**
   - Expose RAG search as MCP tool
   - Enable any agent to query skills semantically
   - Skill invocation tracking

2. **Ecosystem State MCP**
   - Real-time ecosystem metrics
   - Agent status queries
   - Capability discovery

3. **Council MCP**
   - Decision logging
   - Epoch management
   - Proposal workflow

**Rationale**: MCPs make capabilities composable and accessible ecosystem-wide

## 🏛️ Council Recommendations

### Architect (Meta-Orchestrator)
> "Option A first. Users who can see progress stay engaged. The bottle city view enables trust. Then Option C - MCP servers are the nervous system that lets us scale."

### Archivist (Historian)
> "Option A creates a record of our evolution. The timeline and progress tracker become documentation that writes itself. Strong support."

### Cartographer (Explorer)
> "Before activating more agents (Option B), we need to know what we have. Visualization reveals gaps. Option A enables Option B."

### Weaver (RAG Specialist)
> "The RAG system is ready to power search. Option A's skill search component would be an excellent proving ground. Support A, then C."

### Smith (Infrastructure)
> "Option C excites me - MCP servers are tools I'd forge. But tools without visibility are invisible. A then C."

### Visualizer (Portal Builder)
> "Obviously A. This is my purpose. I've been waiting. Let me build the bottle city view."

### Scout (Intelligence)
> "I can run in background regardless. Support A for main focus, but let me continue intel gathering in parallel."

### Librarian (Curator)
> "Content curation can proceed in background. Visualization helps me understand what content is missing."

### Liaison (Human Interface)
> "The user asked directly for visibility. Option A is the clear answer. Transparency builds trust."

## 🚀 Activation Request

**Primary Focus**: Option A (Visibility First)
**Secondary (Background)**: Scout intel gathering, Librarian curation

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Approve Epoch 3 proposal** ← Human decision needed
2. **Spawn Visualizer** for capability graph development
3. **Spawn Smith** to finish integration test generator
4. **Spawn Scout** (background) for intel reports
