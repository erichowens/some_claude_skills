**Build authentic expertise, authentic community, authentic growth.**

---

## Executive Summary

Some Claude Skills occupies a unique position in the Claude Code ecosystem: **48+ rigorously curated skills** from an **ex-Meta ML engineer** with deep domain expertise, wrapped in a **nostalgic Windows 3.1 aesthetic** that creates genuine differentiation. The content strategy leverages three pillars:

1. **Founder Authority** - Erich's story and technical credibility

**Success metrics (90 days):**
- 500+ YouTube subscribers with 10k+ watch time
- 2k+ Discord community members
- 15+ tutorial articles published
- 250k+ monthly impressions on social media
- 40%+ skill detail page engagement rate

---

## Part 1: Video Content Strategy

### Why Video First?

Claude Code developers are builders who learn by doing. Erich is a solo creator with deep technical knowledge—the perfect formula for authentic, technical video content. Video is also your highest-leverage content type: one 15-minute skill demo generates:

- 1 YouTube video (long-form)
- 3-5 TikTok clips / YouTube Shorts (15-60s each)
- 3-4 LinkedIn posts (screenshots + transcript)
- 1 Twitter/X thread (key insights)
- 1 documented case study (blog post)

### Video Types & Production Roadmap

#### 1. **Skill Spotlight Videos** (7-12 minutes)
**Pattern:** "How the [Skill Name] Skill Saves Time on [Specific Task]"

The core content type. Each video:
- Opens with a real problem Erich solved (founder credibility)
- Demonstrates the skill in action (screen recording)
- Shows before/after output
- Provides 2-3 actionable tips
- Ends with "Try it yourself" CTA

**Examples:**
- "How the Design System Creator Skill Built Our Site" (7 min)
- "The Code-Necromancer Skill Resurrected 10-Year-Old Code" (9 min)
- "ADHD Daily Planner: How This Skill Manages My Time Blindness" (8 min)

**Production approach:**
- Erich records his screen using ScreenFlow (macOS native)
- Minimal editing: add skill name graphic at 0:05, category badge, CTA at end
- Use the Win31 aesthetic for title cards and overlays
- No voiceover (use on-screen text + captions)—see below for reasoning

**Cadence:** 2 videos/week (target: 48 skills = 24 weeks of core content)

**Why no voiceover:**
- Developers can watch at 2x speed without losing comprehension
- Text + captions are more accessible
- Forces clarity (if you can't explain it in text, it's not clear enough)
- Enables multilingual understanding via auto-translated captions

**Publishing:**
1. YouTube channel (primary) - full 7-12 min version
2. YouTube Shorts (3 clips extracted per video)
3. TikTok (cross-post Shorts via native app)
4. LinkedIn (3 posts: intro shot + key tip + CTA with link)
5. Twitter/X (1 thread connecting the 3 LinkedIn posts)

---

#### 2. **Project-Based Tutorials** (15-25 minutes)
**Pattern:** "Build [Useful Project] Using [3-4 Skills Together]"

These demonstrate skill orchestration and real-world workflows. They're higher production value and drive traffic because they answer "how do I actually use this?"

**Examples:**
- "Build a Markdown to Podcast Pipeline" (agent-creator + voice-audio-engineer + drizzle-migrations) - 18 min
- "Create Your Portfolio Site in 30 Minutes" (web-design-expert + design-system-creator + native-app-designer) - 22 min
- "From Burnout to Productivity: ADHD-Friendly Project Management" (project-management-guru-adhd + adhd-daily-planner + wisdom-accountability-coach) - 20 min

**Production approach:**
- Narration (Erich's voice) for continuity
- Mix of screen recording + slides
- Show the CLAUDE.md instructions side-by-side with the result
- Slow down at critical moments (10 seconds per complex step)
- Include failure moments ("this didn't work, here's why")

**Cadence:** 1 video/month (12 projects in 90 days, can expand)

**Publishing:**
1. YouTube (primary)
2. Embedded on skill detail pages (as "Next Steps")
3. Shared in Discord as community learning material
4. LinkedIn (as course progress posts)

---

#### 3. **Founder Story Videos** (3-5 minutes)
**Pattern:** "Why I Built [Skill Name]" or "The Time [Skill] Changed My Work"

These humanize the project and create emotional connection. They're higher-view content because they're about the person, not just the tool.

**Examples:**
- "Why I Built the ADHD Design Expert Skill" - 4 min
- "From Meta to Solo Creator: The Skills That Changed Everything" - 5 min
- "The Most Underrated Skill in This Collection" - 3 min

**Production approach:**
- Erich on camera (just his face on a Win31 desktop background)
- No script—authentic rambling preferred
- Mobile-phone quality is fine (adds authenticity)
- Opens/closes with Win31 boot animation

**Cadence:** 1 video/week

**Publishing:**
1. YouTube (Shorts format, 3-5 min)
2. LinkedIn (native video, with transcript in comments)
3. Twitter/X (link to YouTube)
4. Discord (shared with "This is why I care about this skill" context)

---

#### 4. **Community Tutorial Requests** (Varies)
**Pattern:** "I Built [Skill] Based on Your Feedback"

Occasional videos created based on Discord/community feedback. These build ownership and engagement. Request them in Discord, vote on which one gets filmed.

**Cadence:** 1 video/month (based on community votes)

---

### Video Production Workflow (Solo Creator Edition)

**Tools:**
- Screen Recording: ScreenFlow ($99, one-time)
- Edit: Final Cut Pro ($300, one-time) OR DaVinci Resolve (free)
- Thumbnails: Canva (pro version, $120/year)
- Captions/Subtitles: Descript ($120/year—it auto-generates captions AND provides transcript)

**Process per video:**
1. **Record** (30 min) - ScreenFlow, one take with notes
2. **Transcribe** (5 min) - Descript auto-generates
3. **Edit** (45 min) - Cut fluff, add graphics, export in multiple formats
4. **Optimize** (15 min) - Create thumbnail, write SEO-optimized title/description
5. **Publish** (10 min) - Upload to YouTube, generate Shorts, cross-post
6. **Repurpose** (20 min) - Extract clips for social, write blog post outline

**Total per skill spotlight: ~2 hours**

This is sustainable at 2/week if done in batches (film 2 videos Monday, edit Tuesday/Wednesday, publish Thursday-Friday).

---

### YouTube Channel Setup

**Channel branding:**

## Part 3: Social Media & Community Strategy

### The Retro Aesthetic Advantage

The Windows 3.1 aesthetic is your **only moat against bigger players**. Use it consistently:

- **Every social post** includes a Win31 element (screenshot, icon, aesthetic)
- **All graphics** use the classic Win31 color palette (#C0C0C0 light gray, #000080 navy)
- **Tagline consistency:** "Building expertise, not hype" OR "Curated skills. Authentic tools."
- **Voice:** Erich's genuine, slightly self-deprecating, technical

The retro aesthetic attracts:
- Developers with good taste (nostalgia, intentional aesthetic)
- Communities that value curation over hype (excludes get-rich-quick crowds)
- Designers/creatives (unique visual identity)

---

### Platform Strategy

#### **YouTube** (Primary)
See detailed video section above. Target: 500 subscribers, 10k watch hours by day 90.

---

#### **Discord** (Community Hub)
**Purpose:** Live feedback, community learning, skill requests, announcements

**Channels:**
```
#announcements
  - New videos, tutorials, features
  - Skill releases & updates
  - Community highlights

#skill-requests
  - Community votes on next video/tutorial topic
  - Feedback on existing skills

  - Use case brainstorming

#contributors
  - For people submitting skills/tutorials
  - Feedback on contributions
  - Contributor-only announcements

  - General chat, memes, win31 nostalgia
  - Relationship-building
```

**Growth strategy:**
- Link Discord in every YouTube video CTA
- Post in relevant AI/Claude communities (Anthropic Discord, r/Claude, etc.) with "Join our community" intro
- Seed with 50 beta members from Twitter/Dev.to early adopters
- Growth target: 250 members in 90 days

**Cadence:**
- Erich responds in #help within 24 hours (priority)
- Weekly community spotlight in #showcase
- Friday skill voting in #skill-requests (winner gets filmed next week)

---

#### **Twitter/X** (Thought Leadership)

- "The Mistake I Made Building [Skill]..."
- "Why [Obscure Skill] Is Actually Your Superpower"
- "[Skill Name] Helped Me Solve [Real Problem] in Production"
- "The Untold Story Behind Building 48+ Skills"

**Hashtag strategy:**

**Strategy:** Don't self-promote aggressively. Build genuine community presence first.

**Where to show up:**
- r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLM, r/DevTools
- Hacker News (comment on AI/productivity posts)
- r/ADHD (when sharing ADHD-specific content)

**Approach:**
- Answer questions about Claude Code / skills ecosystem
- Share blog posts when relevant (not self-promotion, genuine answer)
- Provide context that shows expertise ("I built the design-system-creator skill, here's...")
- Upvote and engage with community

**Success metric:** Natural link traffic from Reddit/HN (don't track promotion, just presence)

---

**Purpose:** Convert blog readers + Discord members into owned audience

**Setup:**
- Newsletter signup on every blog post
- Newsletter signup on someclaudeskills.com homepage (pop-up or embed)

3. **Community Win** (200 words) - Member success story
4. **Upcoming** (100 words) - What's coming next week

**Growth targets:**
- 500 subscribers in 90 days (conservative, assuming 100 blog readers/week)
- 20% open rate (industry standard for creator content)
- 5% click-through rate (expert audience)

**Template:**
```
Subject: [Skill Name] Just Changed How I Build [Outcome]

## Part 4: SEO & Content Discovery Strategy

### Keyword Research (Your Unfair Advantage)

Claude Code/Skills is an emerging category. Google isn't fully indexing it yet. **This is your window to own these keywords:**

**High-intent keywords (people actively searching):**
- "Claude Code skills" (low competition, high relevance)
- "Best Claude Code skills for [role]" (conversational, decision-stage)
- "How to use Claude Code" (informational)
- "Claude Code tutorial" (transactional)
- "Claude Code CLAUDE.md" (technical)
- "Claude Code vs Cursor" (comparison, opportunity)

**Supporting keywords:**
- "AI pair programming"
- "Developer productivity tools 2026"
- "Prompt engineering skills"
- "AI workflow automation"

**Where to target:**
1. **Blog titles** - One keyword per article
2. **Meta descriptions** - Include keyword naturally
3. **H1 + H2s** - Keyword in main heading, synonym in subheadings
4. **Internal links** - Link between related articles using keyword anchors

---

### On-Page SEO Checklist (For Every Article)

```
□ Title includes primary keyword + benefit (60 char max)
□ Meta description has keyword + CTA (160 chars)
□ First paragraph includes keyword (naturally)
□ H1 matches title
□ H2s include synonyms/variants of keyword
□ Body text 2,000+ words (for authority)
□ Include 2-3 embedded videos
□ Link to related articles (3-5 internal links per 2k words)
□ Include skill cards (inline CTAs)
□ External links to Anthropic docs (authority)
□ Last updated date visible
□ Author bio with credentials
□ CTA button at end (not just text)
□ Mobile-responsive (test on phone)
□ Core Web Vitals optimized (&lt;1.5s LCP, &lt;0.1s CLS, &lt;300ms FID)
```

---

### Content Interlinking Strategy

Create a "topical authority" structure where articles link in a way that builds credibility:

```
Foundation Article
├─ Getting Started with Claude Code (SEO: "Claude Code tutorial")
├─ What Are Claude Code Skills (SEO: "Claude Code skills")
│
├─ Role-Based Hub Pages
│  ├─ Skills for Developers (links to 5 developer skills)
│  ├─ Skills for Designers (links to 5 designer skills)
│  └─ Skills for Founders (links to 5 founder skills)
│
├─ Skill-Specific Pages (48 pages)
│  ├─ [Skill Name] Quick Start
│  ├─ [Skill Name] Advanced Guide
│  └─ [Skill Name] Case Study
│
└─ Meta/Strategy Articles
   ├─ How to Build Skills (contributor-focused)
   ├─ Skill Composition Patterns
   └─ The Future of Claude Code Skills
```

**Internal linking rule:** Every article links to 3-5 related articles using varied anchor text.

---

### Link Building Strategy (Sustainable)

**Inbound links** signal authority to Google. Build these authentically:

1. **Anthropic Ecosystem**
   - Reach out to Anthropic team for feature mentions (if Claude skills blog exists)
   - Link-bait: "48 Skills Built for Claude Code" (newsworthy)
   - Partner with Vercel (they published a Claude Code skill), ask for reciprocal link

2. **Developer Communities**
   - Dev.to: Cross-post tutorials (6-month embargo, then cross-post)
   - Hashnode: Guest posts in AI/productivity sections
   - Medium: Long-form articles on building skills
   - These get organic links from other writers citing you

3. **ADHD + Accessibility Communities**
   - ADHD design & neurodivergent UX communities care deeply
   - Reach out to neurodiversity advocates (they amplify good work)
   - Co-create content with ADHD advocates

4. **Skill Creator Communities**
   - Discord servers of Claude Code users
   - If external skills emerge, mention them (they'll reciprocate)
   - Host "Skill Creator Mastermind" (email roundup)

5. **llms.txt for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)**
   - Create `/llms.txt` file on someclaudeskills.com root
   - Include summary of all skills + links
   - Google's AI Overviews will cite this (appeared in 25% more results in 2025)
   - This is free organic traffic to your site

---

### Tracking & Optimization

**Metrics that matter:**
- Organic traffic (Google Analytics)
- Keyword rankings (Ahrefs/SEMrush free tier)
- Click-through rate (CTR) from search results
- Engagement rate (scroll depth, time on page)
- Conversion rate (tutorial readers → YouTube/Discord)

**Monthly review:**
- Which articles drove the most organic traffic?
- Which keywords are you closest to ranking #1 for? (Invest more here)
- Which skill tutorials convert best? (Double down)
- Update old articles (refresh publish date, add new info)

---

### "Skill of the Week" Series

**Format:** Rotating feature on every platform

Every Friday:
1. **Twitter** - Skill spotlight thread (400 words, how Erich uses it)
2. **LinkedIn** - Career/productivity angle of the skill
3. **Discord** - Deep dive + community Q&A with Erich
4. **Newsletter** - Full tutorial excerpt
5. **YouTube** - If new video not published that week, repost old skill video with "Throwback: [Skill Name]"

This creates predictable content rhythm and gives lurkers a reason to check in weekly.

---

### "50-Skill Challenge"

**Format:** Community challenge to try 50 different skills in 50 days

**How it works:**
1. Announce in Discord + email
2. Provide checklist (50 skills with quick-start links)
3. Members screenshot/share as they try each skill
4. Prizes: Leaderboard (first to 50), random weekly winners (paid API credits, etc.)
5. Final video: "I Tried All 50 Skills in 50 Days"

**Why this matters:**
- Increases engagement (repeat site visits for 50 days)
- Generates user-generated content (screenshots for marketing)
- Community building (shared challenge)
- Drives skill discovery (people try skills they didn't know existed)

---

### Artifacts Showcase Series

Some Claude Skills already has an **artifacts** section showing skills in action. Lean into this:

**Monthly video:** "Building an Artifact with [Skill Name]"
- Shows the before/after
- Walks through the creation process
- Links to artifact page
- Drives artifact discovery traffic

## Closing: Your Competitive Advantages

### Why This Strategy Works for Some Claude Skills

1. **Founder Authority** - You're not a content agency. You're the creator of the tools you're teaching. This builds trust.

2. **Authentic Curation** - In an age of "1,000 AI tools every week," curation is rare and valuable. Lean into "quality > quantity."

3. **Retro Aesthetic** - It's genuinely unique. Every piece of content is immediately recognizable as "Some Claude Skills." It's ownable.

4. **Educational Content** - Developers are starving for practical, honest tutorials. Give them that, and they'll follow you.

5. **Community Building** - Discord becomes your moat. A community of skill-users is more valuable than follower counts.

6. **Ecosystem Timing** - Claude Code is still early. You can own keywords and categories before bigger players move in.

### 90-Day Success = Foundation for Long-Term Growth

If you hit the metrics above (500 YouTube subscribers, 10k watch hours, 500 Discord members, 15+ blog articles), you'll have:

- **Organic traffic funnel** (blog → YouTube → Discord → email)
- **Content assets** (32+ videos, 15+ articles, 5+ tutorials)
- **Community** (engaged skill users creating feedback loops)
- **Data** (you'll know what resonates and what doesn't)

From there, expansion is straightforward:
- YouTube monetization (10k subs → ad revenue)
- Sponsorships (AI tool companies wanting placement)
- Premium content (courses, advanced workshops)
- Consulting (companies wanting custom skills)

**But first: Build the foundation.**
