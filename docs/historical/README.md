# Historical Documentation

This directory contains archived development documentation, migration logs, and historical records from various development phases of the Claude Skills project.

## Contents

### Category and Structure Migration
- **`CATEGORY_MIGRATION.md`** - Documentation of skills category reorganization and taxonomy changes
- **`CODE_CHANGES_VISUAL_GUIDE.md`** - Visual guide to significant code changes during development

### Conversion and Integration Logs
- **`CONVERSION_LOG.md`** - Detailed log of skill conversion and integration processes
- **`CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md`** - Summary of conversion activities and outcomes

## Purpose

These documents serve as:
- **Historical Reference** - Understanding how the project evolved
- **Decision Records** - Why certain architectural choices were made
- **Migration Guides** - How transformations were accomplished
- **Development Archives** - Preserving knowledge from past development phases

## When to Add Documents Here

Move documents to `/docs/historical/` when:
1. They describe completed migrations or conversions
2. They document historical decisions no longer actively referenced
3. They provide context for past development phases
4. They're valuable for reference but not actively maintained

## Active Documentation

For current, actively maintained documentation, see:
- `/planning/` - Current roadmaps and planning documents
- `/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/docs/` (other files) - Current development documentation
- `/website/docs/` - Published user-facing documentation
