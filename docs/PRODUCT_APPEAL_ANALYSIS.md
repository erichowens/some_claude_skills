## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Strong identity fit for creative developers** - The Windows 3.1 aesthetic creates instant recognition and emotional resonance with a specific audience, but may alienate enterprise users.

2. **Critical onboarding gap** - No `/docs/getting-started` page exists (404). Users who want to start have no clear path beyond copy-pasting a command they may not understand.

3. **High trust, low urgency** - The site excels at professionalism (ex-Meta engineer, MIT license, GitHub) but fails to create problem urgency. Users think "cool, maybe someday" instead of "I need this now."

## 5-Second Test Assessment

| Question | Answer | Score |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **What is this?** | "A collection of Claude skills" | ✅ Clear |
| **Who is it for?** | "Developers who use Claude" | ✅ Clear |
| **What's the core promise?** | "Make Claude expert at things" | ⚠️ Vague |
| **What do I do next?** | Copy a command? Browse? | ❌ Unclear |

**5-Second Score: 6/10** - Two of four clear in 5 seconds

### Critical Issues

1. **CTA ambiguity**: Primary action is a terminal command most visitors won't understand
2. **No educational path**: Where's "What are Claude skills?" for newcomers
3. **Missing urgency trigger**: No "Start in 30 seconds" or "See it in action"

---

## Objection Mapping

| Objection | Type | Currently Addressed? | How to Fix |
|-----------|------|---------------------|------------|
| "What even is a Claude skill?" | Education | ❌ No | Add explainer section above the fold |
| "Is this legit?" | Trust | ✅ Yes | Ex-Meta, GitHub, MIT license |
| "Too complicated to set up" | Effort | ❌ No | Getting started page returns 404! |
| "I don't know which skill to try" | Choice paralysis | ⚠️ Partial | Bundles exist but page 404s |
| "Will this work for my use case?" | Fit | ❌ No | No use-case-based navigation |
| "I'll try it later" | Urgency | ❌ No | No urgency mechanics |
| "How is this different from prompts?" | Differentiation | ❌ No | No comparison or explanation |

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection

### ❌ Feature Soup Absent (Good!)
The headline "Make Claude an Expert at Anything" is benefit-focused, not feature-list. ✅

### ⚠️ Screenshot Hero (Partial Issue)
The hero area has a music player widget which is charming but doesn't show the product outcome. Consider adding:
- "Before/After" of Claude with vs without a skill
- A skill in action (terminal recording or demo)

### ❌ Trust Ladder Violation (Critical)
The primary CTA is:
```
/plugin marketplace add erichowens/some_claude_skills
```

This violates the trust ladder:
1. User hasn't seen value yet
2. User doesn't know what this command does
3. User hasn't even browsed skills
4. Asking for terminal action = high trust requirement

**Fix**: Primary CTA should be "Browse Skills" or "See It In Action"

### ⚠️ Identity Mismatch (Minor)
The Win31 aesthetic strongly targets creative indie devs but the skill catalog includes enterprise topics (HIPAA compliance, site reliability). Consider:
- Separate landing variants for different personas
- "For Enterprise" section with toned-down aesthetic
