3. **What would [persona] expect to find here?**
4. **How would [persona] describe this to a colleague?**

### Example Application

**Decision**: Should the homepage lead with technical depth or accessibility?

**Analysis**:
- Tier 1 personas (Solo Dev, Newcomer, Founder) need accessibility
- Tier 2 personas (ML Practitioner) need depth available but not blocking
- **Resolution**: Lead with accessibility, depth one click away
