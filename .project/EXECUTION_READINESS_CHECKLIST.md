## Ready to Execute?

### What Happens Next (User Approval Required)

**Option A: Launch All 5 Sessions Now**
1. Create 5 new Claude Code instances (one per session)
2. Copy-paste `.project/SESSION_LAUNCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` content into each instance
3. Each session reads its specific instructions + references documentation
4. Sessions run in parallel (Sessions 1-4) with real-time coordination via .CLAUDE_LOCK + .CLAUDE_NOTES.md
5. Session 5 starts after Sessions 1-2 complete

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Sessions 1-4: Start immediately, run for next 8-15 hours
- Session 5: Start ~24 hours later (after 1-2 complete), runs for 4-5 hours
- Total wall-clock time: ~32-48 hours
- Total compute time: ~29 hours
- Total cost: ~$207 (within budget)

**What Needs User Approval First**:
1. ✅ Should we enhance skill-architect now? (2.5 hours) — See SKILL_ARCHITECT_AUDIT.md
2. ✅ Is TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md the right hedge? (User's file in ~/.claude/)
3. ✅ Are the 5 sessions correctly scoped? (See SESSION_LAUNCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
4. ✅ Is the budget allocation fair? ($207 total usable)

## Timeline & Effort Summary

| Phase | Duration | Effort | Owner | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|--------|

| Phase 1: Sessions 1-4 (parallel) | 20-28h | 4 Claude instances | Pending launch | Documentation complete |
| Phase 2: Session 5 (sequential) | 4-5h | 1 Claude instance | Pending Sessions 1-2 | Documentation complete |
| Phase 3: Post-session analysis | 2-3h | User review | After all sessions | Templates ready |
| **Total** | **28-38h** | **5 agents** | **User reviews all** | **Ready to launch** |

## Cost Breakdown

### Token Budget Allocation

| Component | Budget | Used | Remaining | Status |
|-----------|--------|------|-----------|--------|
| Session 1: Stop Controls | $36 | Pending | $36 | Ready |
| Session 2: Cost Verification | $27 | Pending | $27 | Ready |
| Session 3: Design Research | $72 | Pending | $72 | Ready |
| Session 4: Design Generator | $36 | Pending | $36 | Ready |
| Session 5: Magic Demo | $36 | Pending | $36 | Ready |
| **Subtotal** | **$207** | **$0** | **$207** | **Under budget** |
| Contingency (10%) | $23 | Reserved | $23 | Safety net |
| **Total** | **$230** | **$0** | **$230** | **Full budget** |

### Cost Hedges Applied

1. ✅ TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md referenced in every session
2. ✅ Express (30-min) skill workflow documented (saves 50%+ of creation cost)
3. ✅ ROI decision matrix prevents low-value skills (break-even >3 uses)
4. ✅ Compression patterns documented (30-50% token savings in skills)
5. ✅ Post-session cleanup removes low-ROI skills (prevents bloat in future sessions)

**Expected final cost**: ~$150-180 (30-40% under budget due to hedging)

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| Session 1 or 2 exceeds budget | Medium | High | Contingency ($4-6), compress skill creation |
| Session 3 design research incomplete | Medium | High | Pre-load design resources, prioritize trends |
| Session 4 blocked by Session 3 delays | Medium | Medium | Session 4 can start partial design work while 3 finishes |
| Session 5 blocked by Session 1-2 delays | Low | High | Run Sessions 1-2 as highest priority |
| Skill creation overhead inflates costs | Medium | Medium | TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY hedge + express workflow |
| Parallel coordination conflicts | Low | Medium | .CLAUDE_LOCK + .CLAUDE_NOTES.md coordination |

**Mitigation Summary**: Budget contingency is sufficient. Coordination files prevent conflicts. Express workflow prevents overhead.

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Success (MVP)
- [ ] Session 1: Stop button works (users can abort DAGs)
- [ ] Session 2: Cost estimation verified (within ±20%)
- [ ] Session 3: Design catalog built (8 trends, 15+ palettes, 20+ components)
- [ ] Session 4: Design system generator creates valid Tailwind configs
- [ ] Session 5: Demo DAG executes with real-time progress shown
- [ ] All under budget ($230)
- [ ] No critical bugs in production code

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Sessions complete within 80% of estimated time (28h out of 35h)
- [ ] Final cost < $150 (30% under budget)
- [ ] 3+ new skills created and justified (used 3+ times)
- [ ] Demo runs for <3 minutes (impressively fast)
- [ ] All 5 sessions coordinate smoothly (no blockers)

## Approval Needed From User

### Decision 1: Enhance skill-architect?
**Question**: Should we spend 2.5 hours NOW to enhance skill-architect with:
- Token optimization section (references TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md)
- Express (30-min) skill workflow
- Cost-effectiveness framework + decision matrix
- Post-session ROI analysis template

**Recommendation**: YES (2.5h investment pays for itself if we create 3+ skills, which we will)

**Alternative**: Use skill-architect as-is, but sessions won't have cost hedging guidance

### Decision 2: Token hedge acceptable?
**Question**: Is TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md the right hedge? (User's file in ~/.claude/)

**Recommendation**: YES — It's already in your account, contains principles we're using

**Details**: Each session will reference it when creating skills

### Decision 3: Parallel execution ready?
**Question**: Should we launch 4 sessions in parallel (Sessions 1-4) immediately?

**Recommendation**: YES — They have no dependencies, all documentation is ready

**Timeline**: Start Sessions 1-4 simultaneously, Session 5 after 1-2 complete

### Decision 4: Budget allocation fair?
**Question**: Does $207 ($230 with contingency) seem right for 5 sessions + skill creation?

**Breakdown**:
- Sessions: ~100 hours raw compute at Haiku rates (~$0.80/1M tokens)
- Skill creation: ~$50 (15 skills × 1,500-2,000 tokens each)
- Contingency: $23 (10% buffer)

**Recommendation**: YES — Budget is realistic and includes buffer

## What Happens When User Says "GO"

1. **Immediate (10 minutes)**:
   - User approves all 4 decisions above
   - I create `.CLAUDE_LOCK` and `.CLAUDE_NOTES.md` files in both repos
   - User creates 4 new Claude Code instances (S1, S2, S3, S4)

2. **Setup (15 minutes)**:
   - Copy SESSION_LAUNCH_INSTRUCTIONS.md content into each instance
   - Each instance reads its section + documentation
   - Each instance updates .CLAUDE_LOCK with session registration

3. **Execution (32-48 hours)**:
   - Sessions 1-4 run in parallel
   - Real-time coordination via .CLAUDE_LOCK + .CLAUDE_NOTES.md
   - User monitors progress asynchronously
   - Sessions update .CLAUDE_NOTES.md with milestones

4. **Session 5 (After Sessions 1-2 complete)**:
   - User creates 5th Claude Code instance
   - Verifies Sessions 1-2 have completed
   - Session 5 starts (no waiting)

5. **Post-Execution (2-3 hours)**:
   - Each session moves entry to COMPLETED in .CLAUDE_LOCK
   - User reviews .CLAUDE_NOTES.md final status
   - Analyze skills created + ROI
   - Test all 5 sessions' outputs together
