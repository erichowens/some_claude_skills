3><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I first came across <i>Poor Charlie=E2=
=80=99s Almanack</i> in my 20s, when I was trying to learn everything I cou=
ld about what made successful businesses tick. As I leafed through its over=
size pages, I found it to be a refreshing rebuttal of conventional financia=
l wisdom, delivered with unusual simplicity and candor. Never before had I =
heard a venerated businessperson express such trenchant insights about inve=
sting, finance, and the world more broadly, and with such=E2=80=94to use a =
favored Munger phrase=E2=80=94chutzpah. One can=E2=80=99t help but read a l=
ine like =E2=80=9CWithout numerical fluency=E2=80=A6 you are like a one-leg=
ged man in an ass-kicking contest=E2=80=9D and come away not only chuckling=
 but also a little bit wiser.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Years af=
ter that first encounter with =E2=80=9CPoor Charlie,=E2=80=9D I had the pri=
vilege of meeting Charlie at his home in Los Angeles. I was delighted to fi=
nd that he is just as engaging and intellectually curious in person as he i=
s on the page. (He also, I discovered, has considerably more stamina than I=
 do=E2=80=94more than four hours into our dinner, I was ready for bed while=
 Charlie showed no signs of flagging.) Our conversation that night was wide=
-ranging, touching on everything from the economics of ski resorts to raisi=
ng children to the evolution of the news industry. Witnessing Charlie=E2=80=
=99s prodigious intellectual breadth and multidisciplinary mode of reasonin=
g firsthand only reinforced my admiration both for the man himself and for =
this book.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv"><i>Poor Charlie=E2=80=99s A=
lmanack</i> is a testament to the power of thinking across disciplines. It=
=E2=80=99s not just a book about investing; it=E2=80=99s a guide to learnin=
g how to think for yourself to understand the world around you. Charlie=E2=
=80=99s philosophy combines insights from nearly every discipline in which =
he=E2=80=99s ever taken even a passing interest=E2=80=94not only business a=
nd finance but also mathematics, physics, history, ethics, and more=E2=80=
=94delivered with a characteristic irreverence that has persisted for 99 ye=
ars (and counting). His essays extol the virtues of free enterprise, yes, b=
ut also of doing business the right way, with integrity and rigor. Of takin=
g your work very seriously, but never yourself.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-=
5 jXNUcv">While the world looks very different today than it did nearly 100=
 years ago, when Charlie was born in Omaha, Nebraska=E2=80=94arriving befor=
e the Great Depression, between two world wars, and just two years after th=
e establishment of the Irish Free State=E2=80=94Charlie has remained a cons=
tant. His insatiable appetite for learning; his uncanny ability to evaluate=
 businesses using simple frameworks that produce more reliable analysis tha=
n complex financial statements; and his partnership with the Buffett family=
=E2=80=94which started humbly when a teenage Charlie took a job in Warren=
=E2=80=99s grandfather=E2=80=99s grocery store and culminated in one of the=
 most successful investing relationships of all time=E2=80=94have persisted=
 for decades, through boom times and bust. So, too, have many of the esteem=
ed businesses in which Charlie and Warren invested their dollars and their =
confidence.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Although Charlie didn=E2=
=80=99t invent the concept of compounding growth, his success, and that of =
Berkshire Hathaway, is a testament to its existence. The practical wisdom o=
f <i>Poor Charlie=E2=80=99s Almanack</i>, this ode to curiosity, generosity=
, and virtue, will similarly compound, as successive generations of entrepr=
eneurial readers extend his lessons to their own circumstances.<!-- --> </p=
><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Whether you are a seasoned investor or a=
n enthusiastic newcomer, whether you run a business or are seeking to impro=
ve your decision-making skills in everyday life, I encourage you to read Ch=
arlie=E2=80=99s speeches and essays with an open, curious mind. You will be=
 rewarded with insights that stay with you for a lifetime. As Charlie once =
said, =E2=80=9CThere is no better teacher than history in determining the f=

=E2=80=9D The same might be said of <i>Poor Charlie=E2=80=99s Almanack</i>.=

ty.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Subsequently, two centuries went b=
y during which Ben=E2=80=99s thoughts on these subjects were regarded as th=
e last word. Then Charlie Munger stepped forth.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-=
5 jXNUcv">Initially a mere disciple of Ben=E2=80=99s, Charlie was soon brea=
king new ground. What Ben had recommended, Charlie demanded. If Ben suggest=
ed saving pennies, Charlie raised the stakes. If Ben said be prompt, Charli=
e said be early. Life under Ben=E2=80=99s rules began to look positively cu=
shy compared with the rigor demanded by Munger.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-=
5 jXNUcv">Moreover, Charlie consistently practiced what he preached (and oh=
, how he preached). Ben, in his will, created two small philanthropic funds=
 that were designed to teach the magic of compound interest. Early on, Char=
lie decided that this was a subject far too important to be taught through =
some posthumous project. Instead, he opted to become a living lesson in com=
pounding, eschewing frivolous (defined as =E2=80=9Cany=E2=80=9D) expenditur=
es that might sap the power of his example. Consequently, the members of Ch=
arlie=E2=80=99s family learned the joys of extended bus trips while their w=
ealthy friends, imprisoned in private jets, missed these enriching experien=
ces.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In certain areas, however, Charli=
e has not sought to improve on Ben=E2=80=99s thinking. For example, Ben=E2=
=80=99s =E2=80=9CAdvice on the Choice of a Mistress=E2=80=9D essay has left=
 Charlie in the =E2=80=9CI have nothing to add=E2=80=9D mode that is his tr=
ademark at Berkshire annual meetings.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">=
As for myself, I=E2=80=99d like to offer some =E2=80=9CAdvice on the Choice=
 of a Partner.=E2=80=9D Pay attention.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv"=
>Look first for someone both smarter and wiser than you are. After locating=
 him (or her), ask him not to flaunt his superiority so that you may enjoy =
acclaim for the many accomplishments that sprang from his thoughts and advi=
ce. Seek a partner who will never second-guess you nor sulk when you make e=
xpensive mistakes. Look also for a generous soul who will put up his own mo=
ney and work for peanuts. Finally, join with someone who will constantly ad=
d to the fun as you travel a long road together.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=
-5 jXNUcv">All of the above is splendid advice. (I=E2=80=99ve never scored =
less than an A in self-graded exams.) In fact, it=E2=80=99s so splendid tha=
t I set out in 1959 to follow it slavishly. And there was only one partner =
who fit my bill of particulars in every way=E2=80=94Charlie.</p><p class=3D=
"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In Ben=E2=80=99s famous essay, he says that only an =
older mistress makes sense, and he goes on to give eight very good reasons =
as to why this is so. His clincher: =E2=80=9C=E2=80=A6and, lastly, they are=

en other reasons for selecting me. But I definitely meet Ben=E2=80=99s eigh=
th criterion. I couldn=E2=80=99t be more grateful.</p><h2 class=3D"sc-96e5e=

=E2=80=99s some mythology in the idea that I=E2=80=99ve been this great enl=
ightener of Warren. He hasn=E2=80=99t needed much enlightenment. I frankly =
think I get more credit than I deserve. It is true that Warren had a touch =
of brain block from working under Ben Graham and making a ton of money. It=
=E2=80=99s hard to switch from something that=E2=80=99s worked so well. But=
 if Charlie Munger had never lived, the Buffett record would still be prett=
y much what it is.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">It=E2=80=99s hard t=
o believe that he=E2=80=99s getting better with each passing year. It won=
=E2=80=99t go on forever, but Warren is actually improving. It=E2=80=99s re=
markable: Most men in their 70s are not improving, but Warren is. Berkshire=
 is drowning in money=E2=80=94we have great businesses pounding out money. =
When Warren is gone, the acquisition side of Berkshire will not do as well,=
 but the rest will do well. And the acquisition side will do just fine.</p>=
<p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I think the top guy won=E2=80=99t be as s=

 speeches, and writings of Charlie Munger=E2=80=94this generation=E2=80=99s=
 answer to Benjamin Franklin. Charlie=E2=80=99s unique worldview, what he c=

listic. Notice how well Charlie=E2=80=99s thinking stands the test of time:=
 The earliest talk in this collection is almost 20 years old, yet it is as =
relevant today as the day he first delivered it. As you will soon discover,=
 Charlie=E2=80=99s observations and conclusions are based on fundamental hu=
man nature, basic truths, and core principles from a wide range of discipli=
nes.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Throughout the book, Charlie reve=
als his intellect, wit, values, and no end of rhetorical flair. His encyclo=
pedic knowledge allows him to cite references from classical orators to 18t=
h- and 19th-century European literati to pop culture icons of the moment. W=
here else would you find Demosthenes and Cicero juxtaposed against Johnny C=
arson, or today=E2=80=99s investment managers set against Nietzsche, Galile=

><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The quotes, talks, and speeches presente=
d here are rooted in the old-fashioned Midwestern values for which Charlie =
has become known: lifelong learning, intellectual curiosity, sobriety, avoi=
dance of envy and resentment, reliability, learning from the mistakes of ot=
hers, perseverance, objectivity, willingness to test one=E2=80=99s own beli=
efs, and many more. But his advice comes not in the form of stentorian admo=
nishments; instead, Charlie uses humor, inversions (following the directive=
 of the great algebraist, Jacobi, to =E2=80=9Cinvert, always invert=E2=80=
=9D), and paradox to provide sage counsel about life=E2=80=99s toughest cha=
llenges.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie also employs historic=
al and business case studies to great effect. In these presentations, he ma=
kes his points with subtlety and texture, often using a story-like context =
instead of abstract statements of theory. He regales his audience with humo=
rous anecdotes and poignant tales rather than with a blizzard of facts and =
figures. He well knows, and wisely exploits, the traditional role of the st=
oryteller as a purveyor of complex and detailed information. As a result, h=
is lessons hang together in a coherent latticework of knowledge, available =
for recall and use when needed.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">It is =
clear throughout these talks and speeches that Charlie places a premium on =
life decisions over investment decisions. His mental models, drawn from eve=
ry discipline imaginable, recur repeatedly, and in no way focus on =E2=80=
=9Cbusiness portfolio strategy=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cbeta=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=
=9CCAPM.=E2=80=9D Rather, they center on fundamental truth, human accomplis=
hment, human foibles, and the arduous path to wisdom. Charlie once said, =

d to prodigious financial success. Next, we summarize the Munger approach t=
o life, learning, decision-making, and investing. This section details both=
 Charlie=E2=80=99s unconventional way of thinking and his extraordinary wor=

e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In the balance of the book, Charlie speaks to his audience=
 via speeches and talks he gave over a 20-year period. In the expanded thir=
d edition of the book, we added a new talk Charlie delivered at the USC Gou=
ld School of Law Commencement on May 13, 2007. So the original Ten Talks ha=
ve grown to become a not-so-round Eleven Talks. These speeches and addresse=
s cover a wide spectrum of Charlie=E2=80=99s interests, ranging from how on=
e acquires worldly wisdom to how his multiple mental models can be applied =
to business to how the investment strategies used by charitable foundations=
 can be improved. The eleventh talk is a special rendition of =E2=80=9CThe =
Psychology of Human Misjudgment=E2=80=9D that Charlie created especially fo=
r this book.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Each talk is well worth y=
our time not only for the enjoyment it will provide you but also for what y=
ou can absorb from the rich assortment of ideas and practices that Charlie =
relies on. You will probably never find a better opportunity to learn from =
someone so smart=E2=80=94and so forthright. In his talks, Charlie simply op=
ens up and tells it like it is. A special note: Charlie=E2=80=99s redundanc=
y in expressions and examples is purposeful; for the kind of deep =E2=80=9C=
fluency=E2=80=9D he advocates, he knows that repetition is the heart of ins=
truction.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">A word about the style and l=
ayout of the book: Charlie is enormously curious about nearly everything he=
 bumps into in life. Accordingly, as we ourselves bumped into people, place=
s, and subjects mentioned by Charlie in his talks, we supplemented his text=
 with related information, photographs, and other graphics. The sidebars pe=
ppered throughout the talks, for example, serve to explain concepts, add a =
supporting voice, or emphasize an important Munger idea. We hope these will=
 not only inform but also amuse and even encourage you to further pursue th=

cate (Warren once called him the =E2=80=9Cabominable no-man=E2=80=9D), and =
one of the largest stockholders in one of the most successful publicly trad=

 market value has increased an astonishing 13,500 times, from $10 million t=
o roughly $135 billion, without much of an increase in outstanding shares. =
Such phenomenal growth is the singular achievement of these two unassuming =
Midwesterners, who combine their synergistic abilities to recognize and sei=
ze opportunities other businessmen consistently overlook.</p><p class=3D"sc=
-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">While Warren is one of the most admired and publicized =
business leaders in the country, Charlie has purposefully sidestepped the l=
imelight, choosing relative anonymity instead. To better understand this co=
mplex and highly private businessman, we must start at the beginning. Charl=
es Thomas Munger was born on January 1, 1924, in America=E2=80=99s heartlan=
d, Omaha, Nebraska. Many notables share his Midwestern roots: Will Rogers, =
Henry Fonda, John Pershing, Harry Truman, Walt Disney, Ann Landers, Gerald =
Ford=E2=80=94and, of course, Warren Buffett.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 j=
XNUcv">Charlie initially crossed paths with the Buffett family during the f=
ormative years of his life when he worked at Buffett and Son, an upscale gr=
ocery store in Omaha, about six blocks from the Munger household. The boss =
and part owner was Warren=E2=80=99s grandfather, Ernest. A strict disciplin=
arian, he scheduled his young workers for 12-hour shifts with no meals or b=
reaks. According to Charlie, his boss=E2=80=99s staunch anti-socialist atti=
tude was manifested in his rule requiring the boys to present two pennies a=
t the end of their shifts to cover their share of the cost of the new Socia=
l Security Act. In return, they received a $2 daily wage=E2=80=94along with=
 a considerable lecture about the evils of socialism.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e=
5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The arduous working conditions in the Buffett grocery store=
 had a lasting influence on both Charlie and Warren. Warren, six years youn=
ger, served his hard times under Grandpa Ernest several years after his fut=
ure business partner had moved on.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Cha=
rlie=E2=80=99s formal education began at Dundee Elementary School, where he=
 and his younger sisters, Mary and Carol, were indoctrinated with ethical h=
omilies. Charlie=E2=80=99s teachers remember a smart kid who was also incli=
ned to be a bit of a wiseacre. He enjoyed challenging the conventional wisd=
om of teachers and fellow students with his ever-increasing knowledge gaine=
d through voracious reading, particularly biographies. Today, he can=E2=80=
=99t remember the first time he was exposed to the aphorisms of Ben Frankli=
n, but they fueled an ineffaceable admiration for the eclectic and eccentri=
c statesman and inventor. Charlie=E2=80=99s parents, Al and Florence Munger=
, encouraged reading and gave each of their children several books at Chris=
tmas, usually devoured by that night.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">=
At the nearby home of the Mungers=E2=80=99 close friends, the Davises, Char=
lie often read the medical journals belonging to Dr. Ed Davis, who was both=
 his father=E2=80=99s best friend and a family physician. Charlie=E2=80=99s=
 early exposure to Dr. Davis=E2=80=99s medical library spawned a lifelong i=
nterest in science. By the time he was 14, the precocious learner had also =
become one of the doctor=E2=80=99s best friends. Charlie became so interest=
ed in medicine that he watched motion pictures of Dr. Davis, a urologist, p=
erforming surgery and became fascinated with the statistical outcomes of si=
milar procedures in the field.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">At home=
, Charlie developed a fondness for raising hamsters and periodically traded=
 them with other children. Even at an early age, Charlie showed a sagacious=
 negotiating ability and usually gained a bigger specimen or one with unusu=
al coloring. When his brood grew to 35 animals, his mother ordered an end t=
o his hobby because of the pungent odor from his basement hamster farm. One=
 of his sisters remembered years later that the family had to endure the in=
cessant squeaking of hungry hamsters until Charlie arrived home from school=
 to feed them.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie attended Centra=
l High School, a very large public school that was recognized as a good col=
lege preparatory school. The teachers, mostly women, were dedicated to thei=
r work and to their students. The Central High curriculum provided a conven=
tional classic education, in which Charlie naturally excelled because of hi=
s logically driven, inquiring mind.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Th=
roughout elementary and secondary school, Charlie was younger and smaller t=
han his classmates, having been moved ahead in elementary school after his =
mother taught him to read phonically. Too small to compete in regular high =
school sports, he joined the rifle team, earned a varsity letter, and event=
ually became team captain. His letterman=E2=80=99s sweater (=E2=80=9Ca larg=
e letter on a very small chest=E2=80=9D is Charlie=E2=80=99s memory) attrac=
ted attention from coeds who wondered how such a scrawny kid could earn a v=
arsity letter. Fortunately for Charlie, his father was an avid outdoorsman =
and duck hunter and took joy in his son=E2=80=99s marksmanship.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Omaha in the 1920s was the proverbial melting pot=
; different races and religions mixed socially and commercially, and crime =
was practically unknown. Doors and vehicles were left unlocked, and a perso=
n=E2=80=99s word was trusted implicitly. Kids played kick the can on warm s=
ummer evenings and went to Saturday matinees to see the latest talkies, suc=
h as <i>King Kong,</i> a favorite of eight-year-old Charlie.</p><p class=3D=
"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The 1930s brought hard times, and Omaha experienced =
the severity of the Great Depression. Charlie=E2=80=99s observations of the=
 plight of those less fortunate made a lasting impression. He saw hobos roa=
ming the streets looking for handouts and others who were willing to sweep =
a driveway or porch in exchange for a sandwich. Thanks to family connection=
s, Charlie landed a boring job counting passersby; it paid 40=C2=A2 an hour=
. Charlie preferred this work to carrying heavy boxes of groceries.</p><p c=
lass=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie=E2=80=99s grandfather was a respected=
 federal judge, and his father followed in his footsteps to become a prospe=
rous lawyer. Charlie=E2=80=99s immediate family was not dramatically affect=
ed by the Depression, but some members of Charlie=E2=80=99s extended family=
 were. This era provided real learning experiences for young Charlie. He wi=
tnessed the generosity and business acumen of his grandfather as he helped =
rescue a small bank in Stromsburg, Nebraska, that was owned by Charlie=E2=
=80=99s uncle Tom. Because of the miserable economy and drought-damaged cro=
ps, the bank=E2=80=99s farm-based clients were defaulting on loans. Tom had=
 rolled up $35,000 in uncollectible notes when he called upon Grandpa Munge=
r for support. The judge risked nearly half of his assets by exchanging $35=
,000 in sound first mortgages for the bank=E2=80=99s weak loans, thus enabl=
ing Tom to open his doors after Roosevelt=E2=80=99s bank holiday. The judge=
 eventually recovered most of his investment, but not until a great many ye=
ars later.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Judge Munger also sent his =
daughter=E2=80=99s husband, a musician, to pharmacy school and helped him b=
uy a well-located pharmacy that had closed because of the Depression. The b=
usiness prospered and secured the future for Charlie=E2=80=99s aunt. Charli=
e learned that by supporting each other, the Mungers weathered the worst ec=
onomic collapse in the nation=E2=80=99s history.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=
-5 jXNUcv">Fortunately, Al Munger=E2=80=99s law practice prospered during t=
he Depression and was given a boost when the United States Supreme Court ag=
reed to review a tax case involving a small soap-making company he represen=
ted. Coincidently, the huge Colgate-Palmolive Company was also affected by =
the Court=E2=80=99s decision. Concerned that the Midwestern attorney didn=
=E2=80=99t have the requisite experience to argue successfully before the h=
ighest court, Colgate offered to pay Al liberally to step aside and allow a=
 famous New York attorney to take his place. The big-city lawyer lost the c=
ase while Al pocketed a substantial fee. Later, Al joked that he could have=
 lost the case just as well for a much smaller fee. The amount of the fee h=
as never been revealed, but it was enough, when combined with income Al ear=
ned from his other clients, to help keep the Mungers comfortable during the=
 Depression. Charlie also helped the family by working to earn his own spen=
ding money and thus learned firsthand the value of financial independence.<=
/p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In 1941, as the war raged across the A=
tlantic, Charlie graduated from Central High School and left Omaha for the =
University of Michigan. There he chose mathematics as his major, drawn by t=
he appeal of numerical logic and reason. He also discovered physics after e=
nrolling in a basic course to fulfill an academic requirement for science. =
Charlie was fascinated by the power of physics and its boundless reach. In =
particular, he was impressed by the process followed by physicists such as =
Albert Einstein to address the unknown. Physics-like problem-solving was to=
 become a passion for Charlie and is a skill he considers helpful in framin=
g the problems of life. He has often stated that anyone who wants to be suc=
cessful should study physics because its concepts and formulas so beautiful=
ly demonstrate the powers of sound theory.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXN=
Ucv">College-aged men were then in high demand for military service. Days a=
fter turning 19 and completing his second year at Michigan, Charlie enliste=
d in the Army Air Corps in a program that would eventually make him a secon=
d lieutenant. He was sent to the Albuquerque campus of the University of Ne=
w Mexico for studies in general science and engineering. Next, he was shuff=
led to the prestigious California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He w=
as schooled in thermodynamics and the science of meteorology=E2=80=94then e=
ssential to flyers=E2=80=94and trained to become a meteorologist. After com=
pleting his studies at Caltech, Charlie was dispatched to a permanent duty =
station in Nome, Alaska.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">While still i=
n the service, he married Nancy Huggins, a young woman from Pasadena who wa=
s a good friend of his sister Mary at Scripps College. They were stationed =
in Albuquerque and then San Antonio until Charlie was discharged from the A=
rmy Air Corps in 1946. Soon Charlie and Nancy had their first child, a boy =
whom they named Teddy.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Although he had=
 attended several universities, Charlie still did not have a bachelor=E2=80=
=99s degree. Nevertheless, using the GI Bill, he applied to Harvard Law Sch=
ool, where his father had preceded him. His lack of an undergraduate degree=
 threatened to derail him, but a family friend, former Harvard Law School d=
ean Roscoe Pound, interceded on Charlie=E2=80=99s behalf. Charlie was admit=
ted, despite the determination of the admissions office to first send him b=
ack to college.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">As it turned out, Char=
lie had little trouble succeeding at Harvard, though he annoyed a few peopl=
e along the way. Because of his intellect (the Army measured his IQ at the =
top of the curve), Charlie had a tendency to be abrupt, which was often int=
erpreted as rudeness. Actually, Charlie was just in a hurry, and the custom=
ary pleasantries of the classroom were of little concern to him. Even so, h=
e was liked by most of his peers and fully enjoyed the social aspects of st=
udent life in Cambridge.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie gradu=
ated from Harvard Law School in 1948 and was one of 12 in his class of 335 =
to graduate magna cum laude. He considered joining his father=E2=80=99s law=
 practice, but after a discussion with his father, both of them concluded t=
hat Charlie should try a larger city. He headed off to Southern California,=
 a place he had liked while a student at Caltech. After passing the Califor=
nia bar exam, he joined the firm of Wright &amp; Garrett, later renamed Mus=
ick, Peeler &amp; Garrett. Charlie built a house, designed by his architect=
 uncle, Frederick Stott, in South Pasadena, where he and Nancy and their th=
ree children, Teddy, Molly, and Wendy, lived.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 =
jXNUcv">Despite outward appearances, all was not sunny in Charlie=E2=80=99s=
 world. His marriage was in trouble, and he and his wife finally divorced i=
n 1953. Not long thereafter, Charlie learned that his adored son, Teddy, wa=
s terminally ill with leukemia. It was a significant burden for 29-year-old=
 Charlie. In that era, before bone marrow transplants, there was no hope. A=
 friend remembers that Charlie would visit his dying son in the hospital an=
d then walk the streets of Pasadena crying.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jX=
NUcv">During this sad time, his friend and law partner, Roy Tolles, arrange=
d through a friend for Charlie to meet Nancy Barry Borthwick, who lived in =
Los Angeles. She was a Stanford graduate and had two small boys, close to t=
he ages of his girls. Charlie and Nancy had much in common and had fun toge=
ther, and after a few months of dating became engaged. They were married in=
 a small family wedding in January 1956, and all four children=E2=80=94his =
girls and her boys, aged four to seven=E2=80=94attended the wedding.</p><p =
class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie and Nancy lived in her house in the =
hills of west Los Angeles for several years. Then, partly to shorten Charli=
e=E2=80=99s daily commute, they moved to Hancock Park, where they still res=
ide. The house they built there was large enough for their ever-expanding f=
amily: three more boys and a girl, for a total of eight. Fortunately, both =
liked children! They also liked golf, the beach, and social clubs. Charlie =
and Nancy were soon members of the University Club, the California Club, th=
e Los Angeles Country Club, and the Beach Club.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-=
5 jXNUcv">With many new responsibilities, Charlie worked hard at his law pr=
actice. Even so, his earnings were unsatisfactory to him as they were based=
 on a combination of billable hours and seniority. He wanted more than what=
 a senior law partner would be able to earn. He sought to be like his firm=
=E2=80=99s leading capitalist clients, in particular the universally admire=
d Harvey Mudd, later the founder of the college bearing his name. With Nanc=
y=E2=80=99s support, he turned to outside ventures and alternative ways to =
generate income. However, he never forgot the sound principles taught by hi=
s grandfather: to concentrate on the task immediately in front of him and t=
o control spending.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Following this con=
servative approach, Charlie seized opportunities to build wealth. He began =
investing in stocks and acquired equity in one of his client=E2=80=99s elec=
tronics businesses, a practice common among lawyers in the mid-1950s and 19=
60s. This investment was mutually beneficial: Charlie gained invaluable kno=
wledge about business, while his client enjoyed the proactive attention of =
a lawyer who knew more than just the law.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNU=
cv">In 1961, Charlie tackled property development for the first time, in pa=
rtnership with Otis Booth, a client and friend. The venture, building condo=
miniums on land near Caltech, was a smashing success, and the partners earn=
ed a handsome profit of $300,000 on a $100,000 investment. Charlie and Otis=
 then undertook other successful construction and development projects in P=
asadena. Later, Charlie participated in similar projects in Alhambra, Calif=
ornia. He sharpened his business acumen by handling the negotiations and co=
ntracts. In all cases, he left all of his profits in real estate ventures s=
o that bigger and bigger projects became possible. When he stopped in 1964,=
 he had a nest egg of $1.4 million from real estate projects alone.</p><p c=
lass=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In February 1962, he joined four colleagues f=
rom Musick, Peeler &amp; Garrett in establishing a new law firm. The origin=
al partners were Roy Tolles, Rod Hills, Dick Esbenshade, Fred Warder, and C=
harlie. They were joined by Rod=E2=80=99s wife, Carla, and James T. Wood, a=
 sole practitioner and friend of the Hills. They named the firm Munger, Tol=
les &amp; Hills. Over the years, the firm had several names, always beginni=
ng with Munger, Tolles. With the addition of Ron Olson, it finally became M=
unger, Tolles &amp; Olson, shortened as Munger Tolles or MTO.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The successful practice of law was by then a back=
stop rather than an ending objective for Charlie. At about the time that he=
 was launching his new law firm, he was carefully crafting his exit plan. C=
harlie set up an investment partnership with Jack Wheeler, and they were la=
ter joined by Al Marshall. The idea for this partnership arose a few years =
earlier when the death of Charlie=E2=80=99s father required him to return t=
o Omaha to administer the estate. To welcome him home, the children of Char=
lie=E2=80=99s friend and medical mentor, Dr. Ed Davis, arranged for a dinne=
r party. Both of the Davis boys, Eddie Jr. and Neil, were former childhood =
chums of Charlie and were now physicians, while their sister Willa had marr=
ied an Omaha businessman, Lee Seemann. The dinner party included Willa and =
Lee, Neil and his wife Joan, and a fellow named Warren Buffett.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie recognized Warren=E2=80=99s family name f=
rom his days at Buffett and Son, and Warren had heard of Charlie a few year=
s earlier when he was raising investment capital in Omaha. At one point, Wa=
rren had met with Dr. Davis and his wife, Dorothy, to explain his investmen=
t philosophy, and they agreed to place a large part of their life savings=
=E2=80=94$100,000=E2=80=94with him. Why? The doctor explained that Warren r=
eminded him of Charlie Munger. Warren didn=E2=80=99t know Charlie but alrea=
dy had at least one good reason to like him.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 j=
XNUcv">During the homecoming dinner, Charlie and Warren realized they share=
d many ideas. It also became evident to the others at the table that this w=
as going to be a two-way conversation. As the evening progressed, the two y=
oung men=E2=80=94Warren was 29 and Charlie 35=E2=80=94became engrossed in a=
 wide-ranging dialogue covering many aspects of business, finance, and hist=
ory. Where one was knowledgeable, the other was just as excited to learn.</=
p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Warren was unenthusiastic about Charlie=
=E2=80=99s continued practice of law. He said that while law might be a goo=
d hobby for Charlie, it was a far less promising business than what Warren =
was doing. Warren=E2=80=99s logic helped Charlie to decide to quit law prac=
tice at the earliest point he could afford to do so.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5=
ea00-5 jXNUcv">When Charlie returned to Los Angeles, the conversations cont=
inued via telephone and lengthy letters, sometimes as long as nine pages. I=
t was evident to both that they were meant to be in business together. Ther=
e was no formal partnership or contractual relationship=E2=80=94the bond wa=
s created by a handshake and backed by two Midwesterners who understood and=
 respected the value of one=E2=80=99s word.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jX=
NUcv">There were many benefits to their partnership: friendship, investment=
 opportunities, and the unique ability to grasp each other=E2=80=99s ideas =
and observations. Later, the two organizations they headed were also benefi=
ciaries. As Warren was investing in and acquiring companies, he sent busine=
ss to Munger Tolles, a practice that allowed him over time to benefit from =
having one of the nation=E2=80=99s top law firms at his disposal. Munger To=
lles, meanwhile, not only got Buffett=E2=80=99s legal fees but also gained =
because his reputation attracted other blue-chip clients to the firm.</p><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Munger Tolles is not just about money, thou=
gh. Mirroring the way Charlie conducts his personal life, the firm has an e=
nviable record of quietly providing pro bono assistance to support groups f=
or impoverished and disadvantaged people in the Los Angeles community. To t=
his day, Charlie continues to influence the firm=E2=80=99s attorneys, remin=
ding them, =E2=80=9CYou don=E2=80=99t need to take the last dollar=E2=80=9D=
 and =E2=80=9CChoose clients as you would friends.=E2=80=9D Though Charlie =
left the firm as an active partner in 1965 after only three years, his inde=
lible influence remains, as indicated by the fact that his name still heads=
 the listing of 175 attorneys. When he left, he didn=E2=80=99t take his sha=
re of the firm=E2=80=99s capital. Instead, he directed that his share go to=
 the estate of his young partner, Fred Warder, who left behind a wife and c=
hildren when he died of cancer.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charli=
e=E2=80=99s plan for financial independence was soon working with great suc=
cess. He spent much time building the asset base of Wheeler, Munger &amp; C=
o., his investment partnership with Jack Wheeler. He also spent time workin=
g on various real estate developments. All was going as planned, with no si=
gnificant reverses. At Wheeler, Munger &amp; Co., Charlie was investing in =
stocks partly with his own money and partly with other people=E2=80=99s mon=
ey. Charlie concentrated more on putting his capital to work than attractin=
g new clients. Because Jack Wheeler held two seats on the Pacific Coast Sto=
ck Exchange, the partnership paid low trading commissions while Wheeler, Mu=
nger kept the overhead cost at close to zero.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 =
jXNUcv">As time passed, Charlie and Warren kept up their frequent telephone=
 conversations and letters, sharing ideas and investment concepts. Sometime=
s they would agree to invest in the same company. Other times they went in =
different directions. In time, their independent portfolios had overlapping=
 investments. Warren invested in the Blue Chip Stamp Co. and became the lar=
gest single shareholder. Charlie became the second-largest shareholder, and=
 eventually, Berkshire Hathaway ended up acquiring the company.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie built the Wheeler, Munger partnership fro=
m 1962 through 1975. It did exceptionally well for the first 11 years, comp=
ounding at 28.3 percent gross (20 percent net) versus 6.7 percent for the D=
ow, without a single down year. But the partnership was hit hard in the vic=
ious bear market of 1973 and 1974 when it fell 31.9 percent and 31.5 percen=
t in back-to-back years, as the partnership=E2=80=99s largest holdings, Blu=
e Chip Stamps and New America Fund, fell sharply. This decline was despite,=
 as Charlie puts it, =E2=80=9Chaving its major investments virtually sure o=
f eventually being saleable at prices higher than the quoted market prices.=
=E2=80=9D But the partnership rebounded strongly in 1975, rising 73.2 perce=
nt, bringing the overall record over 14 years to 19.8 percent (13.7 percent=
 net) compounded annual returns versus 5 percent for the Dow.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">After this difficult experience, Charlie followed=
 Warren in concluding that he no longer wanted to manage funds directly for=
 investors. (Warren had closed his own partnerships in 1969.) Instead, they=
 resolved to build equity through stock ownership in a holding company. Whe=
n Wheeler, Munger was liquidated, its stakeholders received shares in Blue =
Chip Stamps and Diversified Retailing. Later, these shares were converted i=
nto Berkshire Hathaway stock, which ended 1975 at $38. Today, each share is=
 worth more than $85,000, making Charlie a member of the <i>Forbes</i> list=
 of the 400 wealthiest individuals. While he doesn=E2=80=99t mind the wealt=
h, he regrets having his name on any such list. Despite his healthy self-im=
age, Charlie would prefer to be anonymous.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXN=
Ucv">The story of Berkshire Hathaway=E2=80=99s extraordinary success under =
Warren and Charlie=E2=80=99s leadership has been told many times elsewhere,=
 so the details won=E2=80=99t be repeated here. To summarize, however, they=
 have a spectacular track record of identifying undervalued companies and t=
hen either buying large stakes in the public markets or acquiring them outr=
ight. Regarding the latter, they have acquired a diverse assortment of busi=
nesses such as Johns Manville, <i>The Buffalo Evening News</i>, FlightSafet=
y International, NetJets, Shaw Carpet, Benjamin Moore Paint, GEICO, and Dai=
ry Queen. In addition, they have purchased meaningful stakes in public comp=
anies such as <i>The Washington Post</i>, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and American=
 Express. For the most part, they have held their major investments for the=
 long term=E2=80=94in fact, they still own almost every business they=E2=80=
=99ve ever acquired outright.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie=
=E2=80=99s affinity for Benjamin Franklin=E2=80=99s expansive career in gov=
ernment, business, finance, and industry can be found in his many speeches =
and whenever he holds an audience, large or small. At the 75th anniversary =
of See=E2=80=99s Candies, Charlie said=E2=80=9D</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-=
96e5ea00-4 hMWUtG">=E2=80=9CI am a biography nut myself. And I think when y=
ou=E2=80=99re trying to teach the great concepts that work, it helps to tie=
 them into the lives and personalities of the people who developed them. I =
think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That s=
ounds funny, making friends among the =E2=80=9Ceminent dead,=E2=80=9D but i=
f you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the righ=

cation. It=E2=80=99s way better than just giving the basic concepts. =E2=80=
=9D</blockquote><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Franklin used his self-ma=
de wealth to achieve financial independence so he could concentrate on soci=
etal improvement. Charlie admires that trait in his mentor and strives to e=
mulate Franklin. He has had a long involvement with Good Samaritan Hospital=
 and Harvard-Westlake School, both in Los Angeles, and has chaired the boar=
ds of each. He and Nancy have also long supported Stanford University and t=
he Huntington Library Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, =
California. They recently provided funding for a major expansion to the Hun=
tington called the Munger Research Center. Although Charlie is a self-descr=
ibed conservative Republican, chief among his causes is Planned Parenthood.=
 He believes that every child deserves to be born to a welcoming mother. He=
 also supports efforts to improve the environment and the quality of educat=
ion. As the father of 8 and grandfather of 16, Charlie regards his legacy a=
s helping future generations inherit a better world.</p><h2 class=3D"sc-96e=

><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-3 csKXZV"><strong>Do the job right the first time<=
/strong></p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">This story goes back to Minne=
sota times. One of my jobs as a driving-age teen was to pick up and deliver=
 the housekeeper from the town of Cass Lake. This wasn=E2=80=99t just a dri=
ve down the street; the boat had to be driven across the lake to the marina=
, where I would hop into the car to drive to town, and then the process was=
 reversed. Part of my job in the morning was to pick up a newspaper while I=
 was in town.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Well, one day a big stor=
m blew in: rain, waves, wind, etc., big time. With all the excitement and d=
ifficulty, I did get to town in the morning and returned with the maid, but=
 I forgot the paper. Charlie and I had a one-second-or-so discussion after =
I answered the question =E2=80=9CWhere=E2=80=99s my paper?=E2=80=9D in the =
negative. =E2=80=9CGo back and get the paper and never forget it again!=E2=
=80=9D So, back I went through the storm to get the paper, bouncing in the =

at on the lake, the keys fell out of my pocket into five feet of murky wate=
r. I went home and confessed. Of course, in the Great North Woods, there ar=
en=E2=80=99t many locksmiths, and with Charlie, there wasn=E2=80=99t patien=
ce for such stupidity. The solution, again in about a second, was: =E2=80=

hose days when Charlie worked so hard and so long, that was the only meanin=
gful time we spent with him. During the work weeks, he was off before dawn =

lutely had to have a tennis ball practice machine for the court that had be=
en built a few years earlier. While he certainly wanted the children to gro=
ove their groundstrokes, there was a bit more to it than that. For it was F=
ather who was out on the court more than anyone, with the machine positione=
d so he could endlessly practice-volley close by the net. Before long, he m=
astered the well-placed easy put-away volleys, the kinds of shots everyone =
else instinctively tried to kill but usually hit into the net or 10 feet ou=
t. By working on the tennis version of golf=E2=80=99s short game, which few=
 others could be bothered to practice, Father, as he=E2=80=99s done through=
out his life, gave himself a fair if maddening competitive advantage. I rea=

really counts. Thank god it was tennis, not business.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e=

ain and the faces of four presidents simply by taking possession of an upho=
lstered chair, but my father can. All of the Munger children have at one ti=
me or another approached Rushmore to make a request and felt like Dorothy a=
pproaching Oz, except that Oz was more voluble. Rushmore did not always res=
pond. Sometimes my father made a low steady noise from somewhere around his=
 larynx, as though Rushmore had gone volcanic, but that was not so easy to =
interpret. Can you be more subtle than silent?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5=

in the form of speeches he has written, letters he has received and sent, a=
nd articles from varied sources about social policy, psychology, business e=
thics, and law, among other topics. Many of them appear in this book. What =
doesn=E2=80=99t appear is the note my father scrawled on the enclosure. The=
 note is usually extremely brief, and often just a =E2=80=9Csend to=E2=80=
=9D list, but every once in a while the note will have a wry fillip, like t=
his one from 1996, which was appended to a long, appreciative letter from a=
 Berkshire Hathaway shareholder in Sweden: =E2=80=9CI hope you find this am=

my father. Even if he didn=E2=80=99t recognize himself in it, I figured he =
would enjoy the book=E2=80=99s Midwestern milieu, the immigrant striving of=
 the Trillin family, and the humor. The book is written with so much affect=
ion that I thought I could even use it to communicate such feelings to my d=
ad indirectly, which is the preferred route. At the very least, I thought t=
he book might reassure my father that his messages were being received, eve=
n if they were not always heeded.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Abou=

 whether he had read the book or rejected it. It seemed untouched, so I con=

 Not much escapes my father, however. It turned out that he had simply inst=

">Some of my most affectionate memories of my father are of shopping for cl=
othes at Brooks Brothers and Marks and Spencer. Most people already know th=
at Father is not a big fashion man. He once said that he was nonconformist =
enough in his behavior and opinions that it made sense to chart a very stra=
ight course in attire. His going along with normal social customs and his s=
ense of humor, he said, were what allowed his otherwise sometimes prickly t=
emperament to harmonize with other people.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXN=
Ucv">I vividly recall going with my father to Brooks Brothers, when it was =
still housed in that beautiful old wood-paneled building in downtown Los An=
geles, to buy my first serious suit. I must have been about 11 or 12. I can=
 see those polished brass elevator doors opening. We looked through the rac=
ks. Father picked out a pinstriped, charcoal gray suit. When I was 16, we w=
ent to buy another suit, this time a three-piece, which I wore religiously =
during my debate days. It kept the icy wind blowing off the lake at Northwe=
stern during a tournament at bay. We bought, at the same time, a pair of wi=
ngtip shoes for my summer stint at <i>The Daily Journal</i> (a coming-of-ag=
e ceremony required by Father for each boy), shoes which have lasted to thi=
s day. There is another theme here. When we bought a brown tweed coat at Ma=
rks and Spencer in London, Father said, =E2=80=9CThis will always keep its =
crease.=E2=80=9D He admired both stores because they were durable instituti=
ons and because their merchandise was too, and fairly priced. Durability ha=
s always been a first-rate virtue in my father=E2=80=99s view, along with r=
itual and tradition. He never had a desire to change his primary habits, sa=
rtorial or otherwise, once he had, like Franklin, acquired them.</p><p clas=
s=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I still shop at Brooks, partly because each year=
 at Christmas Father gives every child a gift card, which is perfectly time=
d for the winter sale. But I always end up going more often than that. One =
year, I used his largess to purchase trousers with pleats. My father looked=
 at them askance and said, =E2=80=9CDo you want to look like a jazz drummer=
?=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In New York, Brooks is stil=
l housed in its grand old building. I think of my father every time I go; I=
=E2=80=99m very attached to the place. When I went to study at Oxford, in w=
inter 1988, he gave me an old Brooks coat of his, dating from the =E2=80=99=
40s, of a sort of tannish-olive hue, I think, with a warm zip-in lining. As=
 I walked home from the Bodleian Library each night, that nasty, damp, pene=
trating English cold would not get through. When I returned to the United S=
tates, I realized I had left the coat on a bus. I wept at the loss. Even no=

=E2=80=9D approach to business analysis and assessment</h4><p class=3D"sc-9=
6e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie=E2=80=99s approach to investing is quite differen=
t from the more rudimentary systems used by most investors. Instead of maki=
ng a superficial standalone assessment of a company=E2=80=99s financial inf=
ormation, Charlie conducts a comprehensive analysis of both the internal wo=
rkings of the investment candidate as well as the larger, integrated ecosys=
tem in which it operates. He calls the tools he uses to conduct this review=
 his multiple mental models. These models, discussed at length in several o=
f the talks (especially numbers two, three, and four), serve as a framework=
 for gathering, processing, and acting on information. They borrow from and=
 neatly stitch together the analytical tools, methods, and formulas from su=
ch traditional disciplines as history, psychology, physiology, mathematics,=
 engineering, biology, physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and so on=
.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The unassailable logic of Charlie=E2=
=80=99s ecosystem approach to investment analysis: Just as multiple factors=
 shape almost every system, multiple models from a variety of disciplines, =
applied with fluency, are needed to understand that system. As John Muir ob=
served about the interconnectedness of nature, =E2=80=9CWhen we try to pick=
 out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the unive=
rse.=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie seeks to discove=
r the universe hitched to each of his investment candidates by gaining a fi=
rm grasp on all, or at least most, of the relevant factors comprising both =
its internal and external environment. When properly collected and organize=
d, his multiple mental models (about 100 in number, he estimates) provide a=
 context, or latticework, that leads to remarkable insights as to the purpo=
se and nature of life. More pertinent to our purpose here, his models suppl=
y the analytical structure that enables him to reduce the inherent chaos an=
d confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundame=
ntals. Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy=
 and backup system models from engineering; the compound interest model fro=
m mathematics; the breakpoint, tipping moment, and autocatalysis models fro=
m physics and chemistry; the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology;=
 and cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea=
00-5 jXNUcv">The net result of this broad-spectrum analysis is a heightened=
 understanding of how the many factors affecting an investment candidate bl=
end and link to one another. Sometimes this understanding reveals the exist=
ence of second-order, ripple, or spillover effects. Other times the factors=
 employed combine to create enormous =E2=80=9Clollapalooza-level=E2=80=9D r=
esults, good or bad. By applying this framework, Charlie lives in a differe=
nt world from most investors when it comes to investment analysis. His appr=
oach accepts the reality that investment problems are inherently complex, a=
nd in a manner more in keeping with the rigors of scientific inquiry than c=
onventional investing, he attacks them with a staggering degree of preparat=
ion and broad-based research.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie=
=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9Cbig ideas from the big disciplines=E2=80=9D approach to=
 investment evaluation is certainly unique in the business world=E2=80=94as=
 is its origin. Not finding any existing approach adequate to the task, Cha=
rlie painstakingly created his own largely self-taught system. The =E2=80=
=9Cself-taught=E2=80=9D statement is no exaggeration; he once said, =E2=80=
=9CTo this day, I have never taken any course, anywhere, in chemistry, econ=

built.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">It is this signature approach, =
backed by Charlie=E2=80=99s formidable intellect, temperament, and decades =
of relevant experience, that have made him the virtuoso of business pattern=
 recognition so valued by Buffett. Like a chess grandmaster, through logic,=
 instinct, and intuition, he determines the most promising investment moves=
, all the while projecting the illusion that the insight came easily, even =
simply. But make no mistake: This simplicity comes only at the end of a lon=
g journey toward understanding=E2=80=94not at the beginning. His clarity is=
 hard-won, the product of a lifetime of studying the patterns of human beha=
vior, business systems, and a myriad of other scientific disciplines.</p><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie counts preparation, patience, disci=

al itches, or popular wisdom that =E2=80=9Cthis time around it=E2=80=99s di=
fferent.=E2=80=9D When faithfully adhered to, these traits result in one of=
 the best-known Munger characteristics: not buying or selling very often_._=
 Munger, like Buffett, believes a successful investment career boils down t=
o only a handful of decisions. So when Charlie likes a business, he makes a=
 very large bet and typically holds the position for a long period. Charlie=
 calls it =E2=80=9Csit-on-your-ass investing=E2=80=9D and cites its benefit=
s: =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re paying less to brokers, you=E2=80=99re listening=
 to less nonsense, and if it works, the tax system gives you an extra one, =
two, or three percentage points per annum.=E2=80=9D In his view, a portfoli=
o of three companies is plenty of diversification. Accordingly, Charlie is =
willing to commit uncommonly high percentages of his investment capital to =
individual, =E2=80=9Cfocused=E2=80=9D opportunities. Find a Wall Street org=
anization, financial advisor, or mutual fund manager willing to make that s=
tatement!</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Given Charlie=E2=80=99s reco=
rd of success, not to mention Buffett=E2=80=99s endorsement, why aren=E2=80=
=99t his investment practices more routinely emulated by others? Perhaps th=
e answer is that, for most people, Charlie=E2=80=99s multidisciplinary appr=
oach is simply too hard. Further, few investors share Charlie=E2=80=99s wil=
lingness to appear foolish by not following the herd. Religious in his obje=
ctivity, Charlie is content to swim imperturbably against the tide of popul=
ar opinion=E2=80=94indefinitely, if necessary=E2=80=94which is a rare attri=
bute in the average investor. And while this behavior can at times appear s=
imply stubborn or contrarian, that is not the defining characteristic. Char=
lie is simply content to trust his own judgment even when it runs counter t=
o the wisdom of the herd. This lone-wolf aspect of Charlie=E2=80=99s temper=
ament is a rarely appreciated reason why he consistently outperforms the la=
rger investment community. Indeed, if temperament chiefly arises from inbor=
n tendencies, it may be that hard work, intellect, and experience, regardle=
ss of their intensity, are by themselves insufficient to make a great inves=
tor like Charlie Munger. As we shall witness throughout the remainder of th=
is book, the right kind of genetically predetermined wiring is needed as we=
ll.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">At the 2004 Berkshire Hathaway ann=
ual meeting, a young shareholder asked Buffett how to succeed in life. Afte=

 cocaine. Don=E2=80=99t race trains. And avoid AIDS situations.=E2=80=9D Ma=
ny would dismiss his seemingly flippant answer as merely humorous (which it=
 certainly was), but in fact it faithfully reflects both his general views =
on avoiding trouble in life and his particular method for avoiding missteps=
 in investing.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Often, as in this case,=
 Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid=E2=80=94that is, on what =
<i>not</i> to do=E2=80=94before he considers the affirmative steps he will =
take in a given situation. =E2=80=9CAll I want to know is where I=E2=80=99m=
 going to die, so I=E2=80=99ll never go there=E2=80=9D is one of his favori=
te quips. In business, as in life, Charlie gains enormous advantage by summ=
arily eliminating the unpromising portions of the chess board, freeing his =
time and attention for the more productive regions. Charlie strives to redu=
ce complex situations to their most basic, unemotional fundamentals. Yet, w=
ithin this pursuit of rationality and simplicity, he is careful to avoid wh=
at he calls physics envy, the common human craving to reduce enormously com=
plex systems (such as those in economics) to one-size-fits-all Newtonian fo=
rmulas. Instead, he faithfully honors Albert Einstein=E2=80=99s admonition:=
 =E2=80=9CA scientific theory should be as simple as possible, but no simpl=
er.=E2=80=9D Or, in his own words: =E2=80=9CWhat I=E2=80=99m against is bei=
ng very confident and feeling that you know, for sure, that your particular=
 action will do more good than harm. You=E2=80=99re dealing with highly com=

investing outlook. One of the most enduring concepts in Graham=E2=80=99s <i=
>The Intelligent Investor</i> is Mr. Market. Usually, Mr. Market is a tempe=
rate and reasonable fellow, but some days he is gripped by irrational fear =
or greed. Graham cautioned the investor to carefully use his own unemotiona=
l judgment of value instead of relying on the often manic-depressive behavi=
or of the financial markets. Similarly, Charlie recognizes that even among =
the most competent and motivated of people, decisions are not always made o=
n a purely rational basis. For this reason, he considers the psychological =
factors of human misjudgment some of the most important mental models that =
can be applied to an investment opportunity:</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e=

I stay around those spots.=E2=80=9D If Charlie knows anything, he knows his=
 spots: his carefully identified circles of competence. To stay within thes=
e circles, he first applies a basic, overall screen, designed to limit his =
investment field to only =E2=80=9Csimple, understandable candidates.=E2=80=
=9D As he says, =E2=80=9CWe have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and =
too tough to understand.=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">To i=
dentify potential =E2=80=9Cyes=E2=80=9D candidates, Charlie looks for an ea=
sy-to-understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and t=
hrive in all market environments. Understandably, few companies survive thi=
s first cut. Many investor favorites such as pharmaceuticals and technology=
, for example, go straight to the =E2=80=9Ctoo tough to understand=E2=80=9D=
 basket. Heavily promoted =E2=80=9Cdeals=E2=80=9D and IPOs earn immediate n=
os. Those that do survive this first winnowing are subjected to the screens=
 and filters of Charlie=E2=80=99s mental-models approach. The process is in=
tense and Darwinian but also efficient. Charlie detests =E2=80=9Cplacer min=
ing,=E2=80=9D the process of sifting through piles of sand for specks of go=
ld. Instead, he applies his =E2=80=9Cbig ideas from the big disciplines=E2=

n plain sight on the ground.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Throughou=
t his exhaustive evaluation, Charlie is no slave to a database: He takes in=
to account all relevant aspects, both internal and external to the company =
and its industry, even if they are difficult to identify, measure, or reduc=
e to numbers. His thoroughness, however, does not cause him to forget his o=
verall ecosystem theme: Sometimes the maximization or minimization of a sin=
gle factor (notably specialization, as he likes to point out regarding Cost=
co=E2=80=99s discount warehouses) can make that single factor disproportion=
ately important.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie treats financ=
ial reports and their underlying accounting with a Midwestern dose of skept=
icism. At best, they are merely the beginning of a proper calculation of in=
trinsic valuation, not the end. The list of additional factors he examines =
is seemingly endless and includes such things as the current and prospectiv=
e regulatory climate; the state of labor, supplier, and customer relations;=
 the potential impact of changes in technology; competitive strengths and v=
ulnerabilities; pricing power; scalability; environmental issues; and, nota=
bly, the presence of hidden exposures. (Charlie knows that there is no such=
 thing as a riskless investment candidate; he=E2=80=99s searching for those=
 with few risks that are easily understandable.) He recasts all financial s=
tatement figures to fit his own view of reality, including the actual free =
or owners=E2=80=99 cash being produced, inventory and other working capital=
 assets, fixed assets, and such frequently overstated intangible assets as =
goodwill. He also completes an assessment of the true impact, current and f=
uture, of the cost of stock options, pension plans, and retiree medical ben=
efits. He applies equal scrutiny to the liability side of the balance sheet=
. For example, under the right circumstances, he might view an obligation s=
uch as insurance float=E2=80=94premium income that may not be paid out in c=
laims for many years=E2=80=94more properly as an asset. He especially asses=

o they allocate it intelligently on behalf of the owners or do they overcom=
pensate themselves or pursue ego-oriented growth for growth=E2=80=99s sake?=
</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Above all, he attempts to assess and =
understand competitive advantage in every respect=E2=80=94products, markets=
, trademarks, employees, distribution channels, societal trends, and so on=
=E2=80=94and the durability of that advantage. Charlie refers to a company=
=E2=80=99s competitive advantage as its moat: the virtual physical barrier =
it presents against incursions. Superior companies have deep moats that are=
 continuously widened to provide enduring protection. In this vein, Charlie=
 carefully considers competitive destruction forces that, over the long ter=
m, lay siege to most companies. Munger and Buffett are laser-focused on thi=
s issue: Over their long business careers they have learned, sometimes pain=
fully, that few businesses survive over multiple generations. Accordingly, =
they strive to identify and buy only those businesses with a good chance of=
 beating these tough odds.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Finally, Ch=
arlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of the whole business and, wit=
h allowance for potential dilution, etc., to determine an approximate value=
 per share to compare to market prices. This latter comparison is the funda=
mental purpose of the whole process=E2=80=94comparing value (what you get) =
with price (what you pay). On this subject he is famous for his viewpoint t=
hat =E2=80=9Ca great business at a fair price is superior to a fair busines=
s at a great price.=E2=80=9D Warren Buffett often credits Charlie with conv=
incing him of the wisdom of this approach: =E2=80=9CCharlie understood this=
 early. I was a slow learner.=E2=80=9D Charlie=E2=80=99s insight helped Buf=
fett move from pure Benjamin Graham-style investing to focusing on great bu=
sinesses such as <i>The Washington Post</i>, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Gillette, an=
d others.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Though extremely thorough, C=
harlie is able to ignore insignificant detail and the distractions to which=
 others sometimes fall victim. Investment variables, just like all other va=
riables, go through their own process of elimination. By the time he is fin=
ished with his analysis, he has reduced the candidate to its most salient e=
lements and achieved a remarkable degree of confidence about whether or not=
 to act. The evaluation, finally, becomes not so much mathematical as philo=
sophical. Ultimately a =E2=80=9Cfeel=E2=80=9D emerges, a function of both t=
he analysis itself and Charlie=E2=80=99s lifetime of accumulated experience=
 and skill in recognizing patterns.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">At=
 this point, only an exceptionally superior investment candidate will still=
 be in the running. But Charlie does not immediately rush out and buy it. K=
nowing that a necessary companion to proper valuation is proper timing, he =
applies yet a finer screen, a =E2=80=9Cprior to pulling the trigger=E2=80=
=9D checklist, which is especially useful in evaluating what he refers to a=
s close calls. The checklist includes such items as: What are the current p=
rice, volume, and trading considerations? What disclosure timing or other s=
ensitivities exist? Do contingent exit strategies exist? Are better uses of=
 capital currently or potentially available? Is sufficient liquid capital c=
urrently on hand or must it be borrowed? What is the opportunity cost of th=
at capital? And so on.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Charlie=E2=80=
=99s exhaustive screening process requires considerable self-discipline and=
 results in long periods of apparent inactivity. But, as Charlie says, =E2=
=80=9CHard work is an essential element in tracking down and perfecting a s=
trategy, or in executing it.=E2=80=9D For Charlie and Warren, the hard work=
 is continuous, whether it results in current investing activity or not=E2=
=80=94and usually it does not. This habit of committing far more time to le=
arning and thinking than to doing is no accident_._ It is the blend of disc=
ipline and patience exhibited by true masters of a craft: an uncompromising=
 commitment to =E2=80=9Cproperly playing the hand.=E2=80=9D Like world-clas=
s bridge player Richard Zeckhauser, Charlie scores himself not so much on w=
hether he won the hand but rather on how well he played it. While poor outc=
omes are excusable in the Munger-Buffett world=E2=80=94given the fact that =
some outcomes are outside of their control=E2=80=94sloppy preparation and d=
ecision-making are never excusable because they <i>are</i> controllable.</p=
><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">On those relatively few occasions when a=
ll the circumstances are just right and Charlie does invest, he will likely=
 make a large, decisive bet. He does not pick around the edges, take initia=
l positions, or make small, speculative investments. Such behavior implies =
uncertainty, and Charlie=E2=80=99s moves, few as they are, are anything but=
 uncertain. As he says, he practices =E2=80=9Cextreme patience combined wit=
h extreme decisiveness.=E2=80=9D Charlie=E2=80=99s self-confidence is based=
 not on who, or how many, agree or disagree with him but on his ability to =
objectively view and measure himself. This self-mastery affords him rare ob=
jectivity in gauging his actual knowledge, experience, and correctness of t=
hought. Again, we see the important role played by the right kinds of tempe=
ramental qualities: self-discipline, patience, calm, independence. Charlie=
=E2=80=99s level of investment performance is arguably impossible without t=
hem.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">What makes a great business model=
 for Charlie? His recommended reading materials provide some guidance. <i>G=
uns, Germs, and Steel</i>, <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, <i>Ice Age</i>, and <i>=
Darwin=E2=80=99s Blind Spot</i> all have a certain theme: a focus on the is=
sue of competitive destruction and an examination of why some entities are =
nevertheless able to adapt, survive, and even dominate over time. When this=
 theme is extrapolated into investment selection, the preferred Munger busi=
ness emerges: Some thrive by outcompeting (=C3=A0 la <i>Selfish Gene</i>) a=
nd others by out-cooperating (=C3=A0 la <i>Darwin=E2=80=99s Blind Spot</i>)=
. Once again, we see Charlie=E2=80=99s rich fluency across a broad range of=
 disciplines at work: How many investors ever consider, as Charlie routinel=
y does, such a broad and sophisticated spectrum of factors? To name but a f=
ew, he routinely considers factors such as conversion_,_ i.e., how the laws=
 of thermodynamics intersect with laws of economics (for instance, how pape=
r and petroleum become a newspaper delivered to a front door); psychologica=
l tendencies and incentives (notably the extreme behavioral pressures they =
create, both good and bad); and fundamental sustainability over time (the c=
onstant and often deadly interplay between positive factors such as moats a=
nd the ravages of competitive destruction). Charlie is possibly without pee=
r when it comes to the checklist of atypical investment factors he consider=
s and his deep fluency in the diverse disciplines from which they are drawn=
.</p><h4 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-9 ghyoaX">An investing principles checklist</=

p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Let=E2=80=99s go through a list=E2=80=94al=
beit an incomplete one=E2=80=94of possible advantages of scale. Some come f=
rom simple geometry. If you=E2=80=99re building a great circular tank, obvi=
ously, as you build it bigger, the amount of steel you use in the surface g=
oes up with the square and the cubic volume goes up with the cube. So as yo=

steel.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">There are all kinds of things l=
ike that where the simple geometry=E2=80=94the simple reality=E2=80=94gives=
 you an advantage of scale. For example, you can get advantages of scale fr=
om TV advertising. When TV advertising first arrived=E2=80=94when talking c=
olor pictures first came into our living rooms=E2=80=94it was an unbelievab=
ly powerful thing. And in the early days, we had three networks that had wh=

ome little guy couldn=E2=80=99t. And there was no way of buying it in part.=
 Therefore, he couldn=E2=80=99t use it. In effect, if you didn=E2=80=99t ha=

 the most effective technique. So when TV came in, the branded companies th=

 prosperity, at least to some people.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">=
And your advantage of scale can be an informational advantage. If I go to s=

actically no city left in the United States, aside from a few very big ones=

that became classics. Among these impressive titles are <i>Security Analysi=
s</i> and <i>The Intelligent Investor.</i> Graham introduced the concept of=
 intrinsic value and the wisdom of buying stocks at a discount to that valu=
e.</aside><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">But he was, by and large, opera=
ting when the world was in shell-shock from the 1930s, which was the worst =
contraction in the English-speaking world in about 600 years. Wheat in Live=
rpool, I believe, got down to something like a 600-year low, adjusted for i=
nflation. People were so shell-shocked for a long time thereafter that Ben =
Graham could run his Geiger counter over this detritus from the collapse of=
 the 1930s and find things selling below their working capital per share an=
d so on. And in those days, working capital actually belonged to the shareh=
olders. If the employees were no longer useful, you just sacked them all, t=
ook the working capital, and stuck it in the owners=E2=80=99 pockets. That =
was the way capitalism then worked.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">No=
wadays, of course, the accounting is not realistic=E2=80=94because the minu=
te the business starts contracting, significant assets are not there. Under=
 social norms and the new legal rules of the civilization, so much is owed =
to the employees that the minute the enterprise goes into reverse, some of =
the assets on the balance sheet aren=E2=80=99t there anymore.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Now, that might not be true if you run a little a=
uto dealership yourself. You may be able to run it in a way that there=E2=
=80=99s no health plan and this and that so that if the business gets lousy=
, you can take your working capital and go home. But IBM can=E2=80=99t, or =
at least didn=E2=80=99t. Just look at what disappeared from its balance she=
et when it decided that it had to change size both because the world had ch=
anged technologically and because its market position had deteriorated.</p>=
<p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">And in terms of blowing it, IBM is some e=
xample. Those were brilliant, disciplined people. But there was enough turm=
oil in technological change that IBM got bounced off the wave after surfing=
 successfully for 60 years. And that was some collapse=E2=80=94an object le=
sson in the difficulties of technology and one of the reasons why Buffett a=
nd Munger don=E2=80=99t like technology very much. We don=E2=80=99t think w=
e=E2=80=99re any good at it, and strange things can happen.</p><p class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">At any rate, the trouble with what I call the classic=
 Ben Graham concept is that gradually the world wised up, and those real ob=
vious bargains disappeared. You could run your Geiger counter over the rubb=
le, and it wouldn=E2=80=99t click.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 hM=

hammer=E2=80=94to whom, as I mentioned, every problem looks like a nail=E2=
=80=94that the Ben Graham followers responded by changing the calibration o=
n their Geiger counters. In effect, they started defining a bargain in a di=
fferent way. And they kept changing the definition so that they could keep =
doing what they=E2=80=99d always done. And it still worked pretty well. So =
the Ben Graham intellectual system was a very good one.</p><p class=3D"sc-9=
6e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Of course, the best part of it all was his concept of Mr.=
 Market. Instead of thinking the market was efficient, Graham treated it as=
 a manic-depressive who comes by every day. And some days Mr. Market says, =
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll sell you some of my interest for way less than you th=
ink it=E2=80=99s worth.=E2=80=9D And other days, he comes by and says, =E2=
=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll buy your interest at a price that=E2=80=99s way higher t=
han you think it=E2=80=99s worth.=E2=80=9D And you get the option of decidi=
ng whether you want to buy more, sell part of what you already have, or do =
nothing at all.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">To Graham, it was a bl=
essing to be in business with a manic-depressive who gave you this series o=
f options all the time. That was a very significant mental construct. And i=
t=E2=80=99s been very useful to Buffett, for instance, over his whole adult=
 lifetime. However, if we=E2=80=99d stayed with classic Graham the way Ben =
Graham did it, we would never have had the record we have. And that=E2=80=
=99s because Graham wasn=E2=80=99t trying to do what we did.</p><p class=3D=
"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">For example, Graham didn=E2=80=99t want to ever talk=
 to management. And his reason was that, like the best sort of professor ai=
ming his teaching at a mass audience, he was trying to invent a system that=
 anybody could use. And he didn=E2=80=99t feel that the man in the street c=
ould run around and talk to management and learn things. He also had a conc=
ept that management would often couch the information very shrewdly to misl=
ead. Therefore, it was very difficult. And that is still true, of course, h=
uman nature being what it is.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">And so, =
having started out as Grahamites=E2=80=94which, by the way, worked fine=E2=
=80=94we gradually got what I would call better insights. And we realized t=
hat some company that was selling at two or three times book value could st=
ill be a hell of a bargain because of momentums implicit in its position, s=
ometimes combined with an unusual managerial skill plainly present in some =
individual or other or some system or other. And once we=E2=80=99d gotten o=
ver the hurdle of recognizing that a thing could be a bargain based on quan=
titative measures that would have horrified Graham, we started thinking abo=
ut better businesses.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">And, by the way,=
 the bulk of the billions in Berkshire Hathaway have come from the better b=
usinesses. Much of the first $200 or $300 million came from scrambling arou=
nd with our Geiger counter. But the great bulk of the money has come from t=
he great businesses. And even some of the early money was made by being tem=
porarily present in great businesses. Buffett Partnership, for example, own=

ttempt to explain the extreme investment success of Harvard and Yale in rec=
ent years, plus 2) a prediction about the outcomes for the many pools of ca=
pital that will now try to duplicate the past success of Harvard and Yale b=
y copying or continuing their methods, plus 3) a brief comment about the im=
plications for the efficient market hypothesis as demonstrated in a 2005 bo=
ok, <i>Fortune=E2=80=99s Formula </i>by William Poundstone.</p><p class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">To me, it seems likely that, as Harvard and Yale de-e=
mphasized conventional unleveraged holding of diversified US common stocks,=
 their investment success was boosted by factors including the four describ=
ed below:</p><ul class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-11 jFSHPe"><li class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-1=
2 fNhOLh">By investing in LBO funds, Harvard and Yale introduced leverage i=
nto their results from owning interests in US businesses. And the LBO fund =
structure gave them a way to make their leveraged business investments in a=
 manner safer than is possible in a normal margin account, prone during pan=
ics to forced sales. Decent comparative results often followed in markets w=
ith tolerable general outcomes. And this happened even when net-after-cost =
results from investments in the LBO funds were no better than would have oc=
curred through only slightly leveraged investment in an index of US stocks.=
</li><li class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-12 fNhOLh">In category after category, Harvar=
d and Yale selected or directly employed investment managers who were way a=
bove average in ability, providing additional evidence that investment mark=
ets are not perfectly efficient and that some good investment results come =
from abnormal skill or other abnormal advantage. As one example, Harvard an=
d Yale, by reason of their own prestige, were able to get into some of the =
most profitable high-tech venture capital funds not available to all other =
investors. These funds, using momentum provided by their own past success, =
had an opportunity advantage over less well-established venture capital ope=
rations in that the best entrepreneurs, quite logically, made early present=
ations to the best-regarded funds.</li><li class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-12 fNhOLh">=
Harvard and Yale wisely and opportunistically imitated investment banking f=
irms by going into several activities that were then non-traditional, like =
investing in distressed US corporate bonds and high-coupon foreign bonds an=
d leveraged fixed income arbitrage, during a period when many good opportun=
ities were available to skilled operators in the activities chosen.</li><li=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-12 fNhOLh">Finally, the benefits that came to Harvard=
 and Yale in recent years through leverage and unconventionality were often=
, of course, given a large tailwind by a happy combination of declining int=
erest rates and rising price-earnings ratios for stocks.</li></ul><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The extreme investment success of Harvard and Yal=
e gives me both pleasure and pain. My pleasure comes from this demonstratio=
n that academic skill is often useful in worldly affairs. People like me wh=
o were attracted by academia yet have gone into business naturally respond =
to such worldly achievement much like the many modern scientists who relish=
 the example of Thales of Miletus. This scientist of antiquity made a large=
 profit by leasing most of the olive presses in his area just before the oc=
currence of a particularly bountiful harvest.</p><aside class=3D"sc-96e5ea0=
0-2 gQrWhU">Aristotle identified Thales of Miletus (620s BC=E2=80=93546 BC)=
 as the first person to investigate the idea of a basic originating substan=
ce of matter, a distinction making him the founder of the school of natural=
 philosophy. Thales was interested in almost everything: philosophy, histor=
y, science, mathematics, engineering, geography, and politics. He proposed =
theories to explain many of the events of nature and the cause of change. H=
is questioning approach to the understanding of heavenly phenomena was the =
beginning of Greek astronomy. He founded the Milesian school of natural phi=
losophy and developed the scientific method.</aside><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=
-5 jXNUcv">My pain comes from 1) foreseeing a lot of future adversity for o=
ther worthy institutions, driven by envy and salesmen into enthusiastic imi=
tation of Harvard and Yale, and 2) disapproval of the conduct of many of th=
e salesmen likely to succeed in pushing the imitation=E2=80=94something sim=
ilar to what I fear happened near the end of the high-tech bubble. At that =
time, envy of successful early-stage, high-tech venture capital investors l=
ike Stanford, plus the dubious sales methods of many venture capitalists, c=
aused about $90 billion to rush into low-quality, imitative early-stage ven=
tures that by now may have created as much as $45 billion in net losses for=
 late-coming investors.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Moreover, Harv=
ard and Yale may now need new displays of unconventional wisdom that are di=
fferent from their last displays. It is quite counterintuitive to decrease =
that part of one=E2=80=99s activity that has recently worked best, but this=
 is often a good idea. And so also with reducing one=E2=80=99s perception o=
f one=E2=80=99s needs instead of increasing risks in an attempt to satisfy =
perceived needs.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Talk Two was made in =
1994, about 12 years before this addendum was written. And during that 12 y=
ears much useful thought and data collection has supported the idea that ne=
ither securities markets nor pari-mutuel betting systems at race tracks pre=
vent some venturers from gaining highly satisfactory, way-above-average res=
ults through unusual skill. William Poundstone=E2=80=99s book <i>Fortune=E2=
=80=99s Formula </i>collects much of the modern evidence on this point in a=
 highly entertaining way. Moreover, the book contains an account of the lol=
lapalooza investment record of Claude Shannon, pioneer scientist in informa=

tific reality is often revealed only by math as if math was the language of=
 God. Galileo=E2=80=99s attitude also works well in messy, practical life. =

 with fundamental findings in pendulums, gravity, trajectories, and many ot=

"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The third helpful notion is that it is not enough to=
 think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse, much like =
the rustic who wanted to know where he was going to die so that he=E2=80=99=
d never go there. Indeed, many problems can=E2=80=99t be solved forward. An=
d that is why the great algebraist Carl Jacobi so often said, =E2=80=9CInve=
rt, always invert,=E2=80=9D and why the Pythagoreans thought in reverse to =
prove that the square root of two was an irrational number.</p><aside class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">Pythagoras (582=E2=80=93496 BC), an Ionian (Greek=
) mathematician and philosopher known as =E2=80=9Cthe father of numbers,=E2=
=80=9D is often credited with the discovery of irrational numbers. More lik=
ely, though, the credit belongs to one or more of his followers, the Pythag=
oreans, who produced a proof of the irrationality of the square root of two=
. But Pythagoras, believing that numbers were absolute, rejected irrational=
 numbers and is said to have sentenced their leading proponent to death by =
drowning for his heresy. Generally, an irrational number is any real number=
 that cannot be written as a fraction a/b, with a and b integers and b not =
zero. For a number to be irrational, its expansion in any given base (decim=
al, binary, etc.) never ends and never enters a periodic pattern.</aside><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The fourth helpful notion is that the best =
and most practical wisdom is elementary academic wisdom. But there is one e=
xtremely important qualification: You must think in a multidisciplinary man=
ner. You must routinely use all the easy-to-learn concepts from the freshma=
n course in every basic subject. Where elementary ideas will serve, your pr=
oblem-solving must not be limited, as academia and many business bureaucrac=
ies are limited, by extreme balkanization into disciplines and subdisciplin=
es, with strong taboos against any venture outside assigned territory. Inst=
ead, you must do your multidisciplinary thinking in accord with Ben Frankli=

fects, will often come only from large combinations of factors. For instanc=
e, tuberculosis was tamed, at least for a long time, only by routine, combi=
ned use in each case of three different drugs. And other lollapalooza effec=

Atlanta. You are brought, along with 20 others like you, before a rich and =
eccentric Atlanta citizen named Glotz. Both you and Glotz share two charact=
eristics: First, you routinely use in problem-solving the five helpful noti=
ons, and second, you know all the elementary ideas in all the basic college=
 courses, as taught in 1996. However, all discoverers and all examples demo=
nstrating these elementary ideas come from dates before 1884. Neither you n=
or Glotz knows anything about anything that has happened after 1884.</p><p =
class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Glotz offers to invest $2 million in 1884 do=
llars, yet take only half the equity, for a Glotz Charitable Foundation, in=
 a new corporation organized to go into the non-alcoholic beverage business=
 and remain in that business only, forever. Glotz wants to use a name that =
has somehow charmed him: Coca-Cola.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Th=
e other half of the new corporation=E2=80=99s equity will go to the man who=
 most plausibly demonstrates that his business plan will cause Glotz=E2=80=
=99s foundation to be worth a trillion dollars 150 years later, in the mone=
y of that later time, 2034, despite paying out a large part of its earnings=
 each year as a dividend. This will make the whole new corporation worth $2=
 trillion, even after paying out many billions of dollars in dividends.</p>=
<p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">You have 15 minutes to make your pitch. W=
hat do you say to Glotz?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Here is my so=
lution, my pitch to Glotz, using only the helpful notions and what every br=
ight college sophomore should know:</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">We=
ll, Glotz, the big no-brainer decisions that, to simplify our problem, shou=
ld be made first are as follows: First, we are never going to create someth=
ing worth $2 trillion by selling some generic beverage. Therefore, we must =
make your name, =E2=80=9CCoca-Cola,=E2=80=9D into a strong, legally protect=
ed trademark. Second, we can get to $2 trillion only by starting in Atlanta=
, then succeeding in the rest of the United States, then rapidly succeeding=
 with our new beverage all over the world. This will require developing a p=
roduct that has universal appeal because it harnesses powerful elemental fo=
rces. And the right place to find such powerful elemental forces is in the =
subject matter of elementary academic courses.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5=
 jXNUcv">We will next use numerical fluency to ascertain what our target im=
plies. We can guess reasonably that by 2034 there will be about 8 billion b=
everage consumers in the world. On average, each of these consumers will be=
 much more prosperous in real terms than the average consumer of 1884. Each=
 consumer is composed mostly of water and must ingest about 64 ounces of wa=
ter per day. This is eight 8-ounce servings. Thus, if our new beverage, and=
 other imitative beverages in our new market, can flavor and otherwise impr=
ove only 25 percent of ingested water worldwide, and we can occupy half of =
the new world market, we can sell 2.92 trillion 8-ounce servings in 2034. A=
nd if we can then net 4=C2=A2 per serving, we will earn $117 billion. This =
will be enough, if our business is still growing at a good rate, to make it=
 easily worth $2 trillion.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">A big quest=
ion, of course, is whether 4=C2=A2 per serving is a reasonable profit targe=
t for 2034. And the answer is yes if we can create a beverage with strong u=
niversal appeal. One hundred and fifty years is a long time. The dollar, li=
ke the Roman drachma, will almost surely suffer monetary depreciation. Conc=
urrently, real purchasing power of the average beverage consumer in the wor=
ld will go way up. His proclivity to inexpensively improve his experience w=
hile ingesting water will go up considerably faster. Meanwhile, as technolo=
gy improves, the cost of our simple product, in units of constant purchasin=
g power, will go down. All four factors will work together in favor of our =
4=C2=A2 per serving profit target. Worldwide beverage purchasing power in d=
ollars will probably multiply by a factor of at least 40 over 150 years. Th=
inking in reverse, this makes our profit-per-serving target, under 1884 con=
ditions, a mere one-fortieth of 4=C2=A2 or one-tenth of a cent per serving.=
 This is an easy-to-exceed target as we start out if our new product has un=
iversal appeal.</p><aside class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">The drachma was or=
iginally a unit of currency in classical Greece. The word derives from the =
verb =E2=80=9Cto grasp.=E2=80=9D The drachma was also used in ancient Rome =
in the third century BC and later. Most historians say one Roman drachma wa=
s equivalent to a day=E2=80=99s wages for a laborer.</aside><p class=3D"sc-=
96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">That decided, we must next solve the problem of inventio=
n to create universal appeal. There are two intertwined challenges of large=
 scale. First, over 150 years, we must cause a new-beverage market to assim=
ilate about one-fourth of the world=E2=80=99s water ingestion. Second, we m=
ust so operate that half the new market is ours while all our competitors c=
ombined are left to share the remaining half. These results are lollapalooz=
a results. Accordingly, we must attack our problem by causing every favorab=
le factor we can think of to work for us. Plainly, only a powerful combinat=
ion of many factors is likely to cause the lollapalooza consequences we des=
ire. Fortunately, the solution to these intertwined problems turns out to b=
e fairly easy if one has stayed awake in all the freshman courses.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Let us start by exploring the consequences of =
our simplifying no-brainer decision that we must rely on a strong trademark=
. This conclusion automatically leads to an understanding of the essence of=
 our business in proper elementary academic terms. We can see from the intr=
oductory course in psychology that, in essence, we are going into the busin=
ess of creating and maintaining conditioned reflexes. The Coca-Cola trade n=
ame and trade dress will act as the stimuli, and the purchase and ingestion=
 of our beverage will be the desired responses.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-=

one create and maintain conditioned reflexes? Well, the psychology text giv=
es two answers: 1) by operant conditioning, and 2) by classical conditionin=
g, often called Pavlovian conditioning to honor the great Russian scientist=
. And since we want a lollapalooza result, we must use both conditioning te=
chniques=E2=80=94and all we can invent to enhance effects from each techniq=
ue.</p><aside class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">Ivan Pavlov (1849=E2=80=931936=

andoned theology in favor of chemistry and physiology. Earning his MD in 18=
83, he excelled in physiology and surgical techniques. Later, he studied th=
e secretory activity of digestion and ultimately formulated the laws of con=
ditioned reflexes. Pavlov=E2=80=99s most famous experiment showed that dogs=
 tend to salivate before food is actually delivered to their mouths. This r=
esult led him to a long series of experiments in which he manipulated the s=

products.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">For operant conditioning rew=

<p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Wanting a lollapalooza result, we will na=
turally include rewards in all the categories.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5=
 jXNUcv">To start out, it is easy to decide to design our beverage for cons=
umption cold. There is much less opportunity, without ingesting a beverage,=
 to counteract excessive heat compared with excessive cold. Moreover, with =
excessive heat, much liquid must be consumed, and the reverse is not true.<=
/p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">It is also easy to decide to include b=

imize human pleasure while taking in the sugared water and caffeine we will=
 provide.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">And, to counteract possibili=
ties that desired operant-conditioned reflexes, once created by us, will be=
 extinguished by operant conditioning-employing competing products, there i=
s also an obvious answer: We will make it a permanent obsession in our comp=
any that our beverage, as fast as practicable, will at all times be availab=
le everywhere throughout the world. After all, a competing product, if it i=
s never tried, can=E2=80=99t act as a reward creating a conflicting habit. =

very spouse knows that.</p></blockquote><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">W=
e must next consider the Pavlovian conditioning we must also use. In Pavlov=
ian conditioning, powerful effects come from mere association. The neural s=
ystem of Pavlov=E2=80=99s dog causes it to salivate at the bell it can=E2=
=80=99t eat. And the brain of man yearns for the type of beverage held by t=
he pretty woman he can=E2=80=99t have. And so, Glotz, we must use every sor=
t of decent, honorable Pavlovian conditioning we can think of. For as long =
as we are in business, our beverage and its promotion must be associated in=
 consumer minds with all other things consumers like or admire.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Such extensive Pavlovian conditioning will cost a=
 lot of money, particularly for advertising. We will spend big money as far=
 ahead as we can imagine. But the money will be effectively spent. As we ex=
pand fast in our new-beverage market, our competitors will face gross disad=
vantages of scale in buying advertising to create the Pavlovian conditionin=
g they need. And this outcome, along with other volume-creates-power effect=
s, should help us gain and hold at least 50 percent of the new market every=
where. Indeed, provided buyers are scattered, our higher volumes will give =
us very extreme cost advantages in distribution.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=
-5 jXNUcv">Moreover, Pavlovian effects from mere association will help us c=
hoose the flavor, texture, and color of our new beverage. Considering Pavlo=
vian effects, we will have wisely chosen the exotic and expensive-sounding =
name =E2=80=9CCoca-Cola=E2=80=9D instead of a pedestrian name like =E2=80=
=9CGlotz=E2=80=99s Sugared, Caffeinated Water.=E2=80=9D For similar Pavlovi=
an reasons, it will be wise to have our beverage look pretty much like wine=
 instead of sugared water. So we will artificially color our beverage if it=
 comes out clear. And we will carbonate our water, making our product seem =
like champagne, or some other expensive beverage, while also making its fla=
vor better and imitation harder to arrange for competing products. And, bec=
ause we are going to attach so many expensive psychological effects to our =
flavor, that flavor should be different from any other standard flavor so t=
hat we maximize difficulties for competitors and give no accidental same-fl=
avor benefit to any existing product.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">=
What else from the psychology textbook can help our new business? Well, the=
re is that powerful =E2=80=9Cmonkey-see, monkey-do=E2=80=9D aspect of human=
 nature that psychologists often call social proof. Social proof, imitative=
 consumption triggered by mere sight of consumption, will not only help ind=

half its trademark and did grant perpetual bottling franchises at fixed syr=

annual physical volume target of 2.92 trillion servings if servings grow un=

</li></ul><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">We start with the question: Do =
broadscale professionals need more multidisciplinary skill?</p><p class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">To answer the first question, we must first decide wh=
ether more multidisciplinarity will improve professional cognition. And to =
decide what will cure bad cognition, it will help to know what causes it. O=
ne of Bernard Shaw=E2=80=99s characters explained professional defects as f=
ollows: =E2=80=9CIn the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy aga=
inst the laity.=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">There is a lo=
t of truth in Shaw=E2=80=99s diagnosis, as was early demonstrated when, in =
the 16th century, the dominant profession, the clergy, burned William Tynda=
le at the stake for translating the Bible into English.</p><aside class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">William Tyndale (1495=E2=80=931536), born in Gloucest=
ershire, England, earned a degree from Oxford and became a priest. He found=
 England hostile to his beliefs and spent time in Germany and Belgium, wher=
e he expanded his beliefs and spread the teachings of Martin Luther.</aside=
><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 hMWUtG">=E2=80=9CHis books having been =
burned, and his having become a continuing target of hostility, he nonethel=
ess continued to publish Bible translations and other tracts. After months =
of imprisonment, he was condemned for heresy, strangled to death, and publi=
cly cremated. Later, Tyndale=E2=80=99s translation formed the basis of the =
first royally approved English-language Bible and had great impact on the d=
evelopment of the English language. =E2=80=9D</blockquote><p class=3D"sc-96=
e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">But Shaw plainly understates the problem in implying that =
a conscious, self-interested malevolence is the main culprit. More importan=
t, there are frequent, terrible effects in professionals from intertwined s=
ubconscious mental tendencies, two of which are exceptionally prone to caus=
e trouble: 1) incentive-caused bias, a natural cognitive drift toward the c=
onclusion that what is good for the professional is good for the client and=
 the wider civilization, and 2) man-with-a-hammer tendency, with the name t=
aken from the proverb =E2=80=9CTo a man with only a hammer, every problem t=
ends to look pretty much like a nail.=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5=
 jXNUcv">One partial cure for man-with-a-hammer tendency is obvious: If a m=
an has a vast set of skills over multiple disciplines, he, by definition, c=
arries multiple tools and therefore will limit bad cognitive effects from m=
an-with-a-hammer tendency. Moreover, when he is multidisciplinary enough to=
 absorb from practical psychology the idea that all his life he must fight =
bad effects from both the tendencies I mentioned, both within himself and f=
rom others, he has taken a constructive step on the road to worldly wisdom.=
</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">If A is narrow professional doctrine =
and B consists of the big, extra-useful concepts from other disciplines, th=
en, clearly, the professional possessing A plus B will usually be better of=
f than the poor possessor of A alone. How could it be otherwise? And thus, =
the only rational excuse for not acquiring more B is that it is not practic=
al to do so, given the man=E2=80=99s need for A and the other urgent demand=
s in his life. I will later try to demonstrate that this excuse for unidisc=
iplinarity, at least for our most gifted people, is usually unsound.</p><p =
class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">My second question is so easy to answer that=
 I won=E2=80=99t give it much time. Our education was far too unidisciplina=

cordingly, using a unidisciplinary attack on such problems is like playing =
a bridge hand by counting trumps while ignoring all else. This is bonkers, =
sort of like the Mad Hatter=E2=80=99s tea party. But nonetheless, too much =
that is similar remains present in professional practice and, even worse, h=

long ago sounded an alarm in strong language when he spoke of =E2=80=9Cthe =
fatal unconnectedness of academic disciplines.=E2=80=9D And since then, eli=
te educational institutions, agreeing more and more with Whitehead, have st=

cts are actually successions of these occasions of experience. By grouping =
occasions of experience, something as complex as a human being can be defin=

e><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The natural third question then becomes=
: What is now the goal? What is the essential nature of best-form multidisc=
iplinarity in elite education? This question, too, is easy to answer. All w=
e have to do is examine our most successful narrow-scale education, identif=
y essential elements, and scale up those elements to reach the sensible sol=
ution.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">To find the best educational na=
rrow-scale model, we have to look not at unthreatened schools of education =
and the like, too much driven by our two counterproductive psychological te=
ndencies and other bad influences, but instead look where incentives for ef=
fective education are strongest and results are most closely measured. This=
 leads us to a logical place: the hugely successful education now mandatory=
 for pilots. Yes, I am suggesting today that mighty Harvard would do better=
 if it thought more about pilot training.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea=

h-a-hammer tendency. We don=E2=80=99t want a pilot, ever, to respond to a h=
azard as if it was hazard X just because his mind contains only a hazard X =
model. And so, for that and other reasons, we train a pilot in a strict six=

 enough to enable him to pass one test or two; instead, all his knowledge i=
s raised to practice-based fluency, even in handling two or three intertwin=
ed hazards at once.</li><li class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-12 fNhOLh">Like any good a=
lgebraist, he is made to think sometimes in a forward fashion and sometimes=

o happen and also when to concentrate mostly on avoiding what he does not w=
ant to happen.</li><li class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-12 fNhOLh">His training time is=
 allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage from his later malfuncti=

c-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The need for this clearly correct six-element system, =
with its large demands in a narrow-scale field where stakes are high, is ro=
oted in the deep structure of the human mind. Therefore, we must expect tha=
t the education we need for broadscale problem-solving will keep all these =
elements but with awesomely expanded coverage for each element. How could i=
t be otherwise?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Thus it follows, as th=
e night the day, that in our most elite broadscale education, wherein we ar=
e trying to make silk purses out of silk, we need for best results to have =
multidisciplinary coverage of immense amplitude, with all needed skills rai=
sed to an ever-maintained practice-based fluency, including considerable po=
wer of synthesis at boundaries between disciplines, with the highest fluenc=
y levels being achieved where they are most needed, with forward and revers=
e thinking techniques being employed in a manner reminding one of inversion=
 in algebra, and with =E2=80=9Cchecklist=E2=80=9D routines being a permanen=
t part of the knowledge system. There can be no other way, no easier way, t=
o broadscale worldly wisdom. Thus the task, when first identified in its im=
mense breadth, seems daunting, verging on impossible.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e=
5ea00-5 jXNUcv">But the task, considered in full context, is far from impos=
sible when we consider three factors:</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">=
First, the concept of =E2=80=9Call needed skills=E2=80=9D lets us recognize=
 that we don=E2=80=99t have to raise everyone=E2=80=99s skill in celestial =
mechanics to that of Laplace and also ask everyone to achieve a similar ski=
ll level in all other knowledge. Instead, it turns out that the truly big i=
deas in each discipline, learned only in essence, carry most of the freight=
. And they are not so numerous, nor are their interactions so complex, that=
 a large and multidisciplinary understanding is impossible for many, given =
large amounts of talent and time.</p><aside class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">=
Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749=E2=80=931827), a French mathematician, astronome=
r, and philosopher, discovered many key ideas relating to inductive reasoni=
ng and probability, celestial movement, and causal determinism. In his grea=
t work, <i>A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities,</i> Laplace sets out one=
 of his signature ideas:</aside><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv"></p>=E2=
=80=9CWe may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its =
past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain moment wo=
uld know all forces that set nature in motion, and all positions of all ite=
ms of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough to =
submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the mov=
ements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom=
; for such an intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like=
 the past would be present before its eyes.=E2=80=9D<p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=

of talent and time that we need. After all, we are educating the top 1 perc=

e students. And we have roughly 13 long years in which to turn our most pro=
mising 12-year-olds into starting professionals.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=
-5 jXNUcv">Third, thinking by inversion and thorough use of checklists is e=
asily learned, in broadscale life as in piloting.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea0=
0-5 jXNUcv">Moreover, we can believe in the attainability of broad multidis=
ciplinary skill for the same reason the fellow from Arkansas gave for his b=
elief in baptism: =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ve seen it done.=E2=80=9D We all know =
of individuals, modern Ben Franklins, who have 1) achieved a massive multid=
isciplinary synthesis with less time in formal education than is now availa=

n their own disciplines, not worse, despite diversion of learning time to m=
atter outside the normal coverage of their own disciplines.</p><p class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Given the time and talent available and examples of s=
uccessful masters of multiple disciplines, what is shown by our present fai=
lure to minimize bad effects from man-with-a-hammer tendency is only that y=
ou can=E2=80=99t win big in multidisciplinarity in soft-science academia if=
 you are so satisfied with the status quo, or so frightened by the difficul=
ties of change, that you don=E2=80=99t try hard enough to win big.</p><p cl=
ass=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Which brings us to our fourth question: Judged=
 with reference to an optimized, feasible multidisciplinary goal, how much =
has elite soft-science education been corrected after we left?</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The answer is that many things have been tried as=
 corrections in the direction of better multidisciplinarity. And, after all=
owing for some counterproductive results, there has been some considerable =
improvement, net. But much desirable correction is still undone and lies fa=
r ahead.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">For instance, soft-science ac=
ademia has increasingly found it helpful when professors from different dis=
ciplines collaborate or when a professor has been credentialed in more than=
 one discipline. But a different sort of correction has usually worked best=
, namely augmentation, or a =E2=80=9Ctake what you wish=E2=80=9D practice t=
hat encourages any discipline to simply assimilate whatever it chooses from=

 squabbles rooted in the tradition and territoriality that had caused the u=

es, it helped changes like the assimilation of Freudianism in some literatu=
re departments; the importation into many places of extremist political ide=
ologies of the left or right that had, for their possessors, made regaining=
 objectivity almost as unlikely as regaining virginity; and 3) the importat=

sh=E2=80=9D had some serious defects. For instance, takings from more funda=
mental disciplines were often done without attribution, sometimes under new=
 names, with little attention given to rank in a fundamentalness order for =
absorbed concepts. Such practices 1) act like a lousy filing system that mu=
st impair the successful use and synthesis of absorbed knowledge and 2) do =
not maximize in soft science the equivalent of Linus Pauling=E2=80=99s syst=

/p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">This brings us, finally, to our last q=
uestion: In elite soft science, what practices would hasten our progress to=
ward optimized disciplinarity? Here, again, there are some easy answers:</p=
><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">First, many more courses should be manda=
tory, not optional. And this, in turn, requires that the people who decide =
what is mandatory must possess large, multidisciplinary knowledge maintaine=
d in fluency. This conclusion is as obvious in the training of the would-be=
 broadscale problem-solver as it is in the training of the would-be pilot. =
For instance, both psychology mastery and accounting mastery should be requ=
ired as outcomes in legal education. Yet in many elite places, even today, =
there are no such requirements. Often, such is the narrowness of mind of th=
e program designers that they neither see what is needed and missing nor ar=
e able to fix deficiencies.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 hMWUtG"><=

intained in fluency.</p></blockquote><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Seco=
nd, there should be much more problem-solving practice that crosses several=
 disciplines, including practice that mimics the function of the aircraft s=
imulator in preventing loss of skills through disuse.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e=
5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Let me give an example, roughly remembered, of this sort of=
 teaching by a very wise but untypical Harvard Business School professor ma=
ny decades ago. This professor gave a test involving two unworldly old ladi=
es who had just inherited a New England shoe factory making branded shoes a=
nd beset with serious business problems described in great detail. The prof=
essor then gave the students ample time to answer with written advice to th=
e old ladies. In response to the answers, the professor gave every student =
an undesirable grade except for one student who was graded at the top by a =
wide margin.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">What was the winning answ=
er? It was very short and roughly as follows: =E2=80=9CThis business field =
and this particular business, in its particular location, present crucial p=
roblems that are so difficult that unworldly old ladies cannot wisely try t=
o solve them through hired help. Given the difficulties and unavoidable age=
ncy costs, the old ladies should promptly sell the shoe factory, probably t=
o the competitor who would enjoy the greatest marginal utility advantage.=
=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Thus, the winning answer rel=
ied not on what the students had most recently been taught in business scho=
ol but instead on more fundamental concepts, like agency costs and marginal=
 utility, lifted from undergraduate psychology and economics. Ah, my fellow=
 members of the Harvard Law Class of 1948=E2=80=94if only we had been much =
more often tested like that, just think of what more we might have accompli=
shed!</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Incidentally, many elite private=
 schools now wisely use such multidisciplinary methods in seventh grade sci=
ence, while at the same time many graduate schools have not yet seen the sa=
me light. This is one more sad example of Whitehead=E2=80=99s fatal unconne=
ctedness in education.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 hMWUtG"><p cla=

</blockquote><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Third, most soft-science pro=
fessional schools should increase use of the best business periodicals, lik=
e the <i>Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune,</i> etc. Such periodicals ar=
e now quite good and perform the function of the aircraft simulator if used=
 to prompt practice in relating events to multidisciplinary causes, often i=
ntertwined. And sometimes the periodicals even introduce new models for cau=
ses instead of merely refreshing old knowledge. Also, it is not just slight=
ly sound to have the student practice in school what he must practice lifel=
ong after formal education is over if he is going to maximize his good judg=
ment. I know no person in business, respected for verified good judgment, w=
hose wisdom-maintenance system does not include use of such periodicals. Wh=
y should academia be different?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Fourth=
, in filling scarce academic vacancies, professors of super-strong, passion=
ate political ideology, whether on the left or right, should usually be avo=
ided. So also for students. Best-form multidisciplinarity requires an objec=
tivity such passionate people have lost, and a difficult synthesis is not l=

 fund=E2=80=94is no sure thing to outperform equity indexes in the future i=
f equity indexes perform poorly in the future. In substance, an LBO fund is=
 a better way of buying equivalents of marketable equities on margin, and t=
he debt could prove disastrous if future marketable equity performance is b=
ad. And particularly so if the bad performance comes from generally bad bus=
iness conditions.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The second considera=

st, there has never been an advance so extreme in the price of widespread s=

related wealth effect must now be bigger than was common before. Second, wh=

 Japan, with much financial corruption, there was an extreme rise in stock =
and real estate prices for a very long time, accompanied by extreme real ec=

Japan, a modern economy that had learned all the would-be corrective Keynes=

 years, not only ran an immense government deficit but also reduced interes=

>A median conclusion of the economics professionals, based mostly on data c=
ollected by the Federal Reserve System, would probably be that the wealth e=
ffect on spending from stock prices is not all that big. After all, even no=
w, real household net worth, excluding pensions, is probably up by less tha=
n 100 percent over the last 10 years and remains a pretty modest figure per=
 household, while market value of common stock is probably not yet one-thir=
d of aggregate household net worth, excluding pensions. Moreover, such hous=
ehold wealth in common stocks is almost incredibly concentrated, and the su=
per-rich don=E2=80=99t consume in proportion to their wealth. Leaving out p=
ensions, the top 1 percent of households probably hold about 50 percent of =
common stock value, and the bottom 80 percent probably hold about 4 percent=
.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Based on such data, plus unexciting =
past correlation between stock prices and spending, it is easy for a profes=

s incrementally at a rate of 3 percent of asset values in stock, consumer s=
pending would have risen less than 0.5 percent per year over the last 10 ye=
ars as a consequence of the huge, unprecedented, long-lasting, consistent b=
oom in stock prices.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I believe that su=

 the ultimate amateur, boldly try to do a little better, or at least a litt=
le differently.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">For one thing, I have =
been told, probably correctly, that Federal Reserve data collection, due to=
 practical obstacles, doesn=E2=80=99t properly take into account pension ef=
fects, including effects from 401(k) and similar plans. Assume some 63-year=
-old dentist has $1 million in GE stock in a private pension plan. The stoc=
k goes up in value to $2 million, and the dentist, feeling flush, trades in=
 his very old Chevrolet and leases a new Cadillac at the giveaway rate now =
common. To me, this is an obvious large wealth effect in the dentist=E2=80=
=99s spending. To many economists, using Federal Reserve data, I suspect th=
e occasion looks like profligate dissaving by the dentist. To me, the denti=
st, and many others like him, seems to be spending a lot more because of a =
very strong pension-related wealth effect. Accordingly, I believe that the =
present-day wealth effect from pension plans is far from trivial and much l=
arger than it was in the past.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">For ano=

 3 percent, febezzlers though they are, think they are virtuously earning i=
ncome. The situation is functioning like undisclosed embezzlement without b=
eing self-limited. Indeed, the process can expand for a long while by feedi=

ancial engineering opportunity second to none.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5=
 jXNUcv">For instance, it was mere child=E2=80=99s play for the executives =
to realize that if in 1982 Quant Tech had substituted employee stock option=
 exercise profits for all its incentive bonus expenses of $400 million, whi=
le using bonus money saved plus option prices paid to buy back all shares i=
ssued in option exercises, and keeping all else the same, the result would =
have been to drive Quant Tech=E2=80=99s 1982 reported earnings up by 400 pe=
rcent, to $500 million from $100 million, while shares outstanding remained=
 exactly the same! And so it seemed that the obviously correct ploy for the=
 officers was to start substituting employee stock option exercise profits =
for incentive bonuses. Why should a group of numerate engineers care whethe=
r their bonuses were in cash or virtually perfect equivalents of cash? Arra=
nging such substitutions, on any schedule desired, seemed like no difficult=
 chore.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">However, it was also mere chil=
d=E2=80=99s play for the new officers to realize that a certain amount of c=
aution and restraint would be desirable in pushing their new ploy. Obviousl=
y, if they pushed their new ploy too hard in any single year, there might b=
e rebellion from Quant Tech=E2=80=99s accountants or undesirable hostility =
from other sources. This, in turn, would risk killing a goose with a vast a=
bility to deliver golden eggs, at least to the officers. After all, it was =
quite clear that their ploy would be increasing reported earnings only by a=
dding to real earnings an element of phony earnings=E2=80=94phony in the se=
nse that Quant Tech would enjoy no true favorable economic effect (except a=
 temporary fraud-type effect similar to that from overcounting closing inve=
ntory) from that part of reported earnings increases attributable to use of=
 the ploy. The new CEO privately called the desirable, cautious approach =
=E2=80=9Cwisely restrained falsehood.=E2=80=9D</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-9=

">Plainly, the new officers saw, it would be prudent to shift bonus payment=
s to employee stock option exercise profits in only a moderate amount per y=
ear over many years ahead. They privately called the prudent plan they adop=
ted their =E2=80=9Cdollop-by-dollop system,=E2=80=9D which they believed ha=
d four obvious advantages:</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">First, a mo=
derate dollop of phony earnings in any single year would be less likely to =
be noticed than a large dollop.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Second=
, the large long-term effect from accumulating many moderate dollops of pho=
ny earnings over the years would also tend to be obscured in the dollop-by-=
dollop system. As the CFO pithily and privately said, =E2=80=9CIf we mix on=
ly a moderate minority share of turds with the raisins each year, probably =
no one will recognize what will ultimately become a very large collection o=
f turds.=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Third, the outside a=
ccountants, once they had blessed a few financial statements containing ear=
nings increases, only a minority share of which were phony, would probably =
find it unendurably embarrassing not to bless new financial statements cont=
aining only the same phony proportion of reported earnings increases.</p><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Fourth, the dollop-by-dollop system would t=
end to prevent disgrace, or something more seriously harmful, for Quant Tec=
h=E2=80=99s officers. With virtually all corporations except Quant Tech hav=
ing ever-more liberal stock option plans, the officers could always explain=
 that a moderate dollop of shift toward compensation in option-exercise for=
m was needed to help attract or retain employees. Indeed, given corporate c=
ulture and stock market enthusiasm likely to exist as a consequence of the =
strange accounting convention for stock options, this claim would often be =
true.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">With these four advantages, the =
dollop-by-dollop system seemed so clearly desirable that it only remained f=
or Quant Tech=E2=80=99s officers to decide how big to make their annual dol=
lops of phony earnings. This decision, too, turned out to be easy. The offi=
cers first decided upon three reasonable conditions they wanted satisfied:<=
/p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">First, they wanted to be able to conti=
nue their dollop-by-dollop system without major discontinuities for 20 year=
s.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Second, they wanted Quant Tech=E2=
=80=99s reported earnings to go up by roughly the same percentage each year=
 throughout the whole 20 years, because they believed that financial analys=
ts representing institutional investors would value Quant Tech=E2=80=99s st=
ock higher if reported annual earnings growth never significantly varied.</=
p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Third, to protect credibility for repor=
ted earnings, they never wanted to strain the credulity of investors by rep=
orting, even in their 20th year, that Quant Tech was earning more than 40 p=
ercent of revenues from designing power plants.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-=
5 jXNUcv">With these requirements, the math was easy, given the officers=E2=
=80=99 assumption that Quant Tech=E2=80=99s non-phony earnings and revenues=
 were both going to grow at 20 percent per year for 20 years. The officers =
quickly decided to use their dollop-by-dollop system to make Quant Tech=E2=
=80=99s reported earnings increase by 28 percent per year instead of the 20=
 percent that would have been reported by the founder.</p><p class=3D"sc-96=
e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">And so, the great scheme of modern financial engineering w=
ent forward toward tragedy at Quant Tech. And few disreputable schemes of m=
an have ever worked better in achieving what was attempted. Quant Tech=E2=

y at 28 percent per year. No one criticized Quant Tech=E2=80=99s financial =
reporting except a few people widely regarded as impractical, overly theore=

 of never paying dividends, which was continued, greatly helped in preservi=

at 28 percent per year while cash equivalents grew much faster than they we=

phony element, kept rising at 28 percent, Quant Tech=E2=80=99s income taxes=
 as a percentage of reported pre-tax earnings kept going lower and lower. T=
his plainly increased their chances of attracting undesired questions and c=
riticism. This problem was soon eliminated. Many power plants in foreign na=

per annum, compounded. Before that, for the previous thousands of years, it=
 had gone up at a rate that hovered just a hair=E2=80=99s breadth above zer=

ed the success, and partly it explained it. So, naturally, academic economi=
cs grew. And lately, with the collapse of all the communist economies, as t=

 my psychology talks given about 15 years ago, I realized that I could now =
create a more logical but much longer talk, including most of what I had ea=
rlier said. But I immediately saw four big disadvantages.</p><p class=3D"sc=
-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">First, the longer talk, because it was written out with=
 more logical completeness, would be more boring and confusing to many peop=
le than any earlier talk. This would happen because I would use idiosyncrat=
ic definitions of psychological tendencies in a manner reminiscent of both =
psychology textbooks and Euclid. And who reads textbooks for fun or revisit=
s Euclid?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Second, because my formal ps=
ychological knowledge came only from skimming three psychology textbooks ab=
out 15 years ago, I know virtually nothing about any academic psychology la=
ter developed. Yet in a longer talk containing guesses, I would be criticiz=
ing much academic psychology. This sort of intrusion into a professional te=
rritory by an amateur would be sure to be resented by professors, who would=
 rejoice in finding my errors and might be prompted to respond to my publis=
hed criticism by providing theirs. Why should I care about new criticism? W=
ell, who likes new hostility from articulate critics with an information ad=
vantage?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Third, a longer version of my=
 ideas would surely draw some disapproval from people formerly disposed to =
liking me. Not only would there be stylistic and substantive objections, bu=
t also there would be perceptions of arrogance in an old man who displayed =
much disregard for conventional wisdom while =E2=80=9Cpopping off=E2=80=9D =
on a subject in which he had never taken a course. My old Harvard Law class=
mate, Ed Rothschild, always called such a popping off the shoe-button compl=
ex, named for the condition of a family friend who spoke in oracular style =
on all subjects after becoming dominant in the shoe-button business.</p><p =
class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Fourth, I might make a fool of myself.</p><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Despite these four very considerable object=
ions, I decided to publish the much-expanded version. Thus, after many deca=
des in which I have succeeded mostly by restricting my action to jobs and m=
ethods in which I was unlikely to fail, I have now chosen a course of actio=
n in which 1) I have no significant personal benefit to gain, 2) I will sur=
ely give some pain to family members and friends, and 3) I may make myself =
ridiculous.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Why am I doing this?</p><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">One reason may be that my nature makes me i=
ncline toward diagnosing and talking about errors in conventional wisdom. A=
nd despite years of being smoothed out by the hard knocks that were inevita=
ble for one with my attitude, I don=E2=80=99t believe life ever knocked all=
 the boy=E2=80=99s brashness out of the man.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e=

p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">My third and final reason is the strongest=
. I have fallen in love with my way of laying out psychology because it has=

ucated in an era wherein the contributions of non-patient-treating psycholo=
gy to an understanding of misjudgment met little approval from members of t=
he mainstream elite. Instead, interest in psychology was pretty well confin=
ed to a group of professors who talked and published mostly for themselves,=
 with much natural detriment from isolation and groupthink.</p><p class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">And so, right after my time at Caltech and Harvard La=
w School, I possessed a vast ignorance of psychology. Those institutions fa=
iled to require knowledge of the subject. And, of course, they couldn=E2=80=
=99t integrate psychology with their other subject matter when they didn=E2=
=80=99t know psychology. Also, like the Nietzsche character who was proud o=
f his lame leg, the institutions were proud of their willful avoidance of =
=E2=80=9Cfuzzy=E2=80=9D psychology and =E2=80=9Cfuzzy=E2=80=9D psychology p=
rofessors.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I shared this ignorant mind=
set for a considerable time, and so did a lot of other people. What are we =
to think, for instance, of the Caltech course catalog that for years listed=
 just one psychology professor, self-described as a =E2=80=9Cprofessor of p=
sychoanalytical studies,=E2=80=9D who taught both abnormal psychology and p=
sychoanalysis in literature?</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Soon afte=
r leaving Harvard, I began a long struggle to get rid of the most dysfuncti=
onal part of my psychological ignorance. Today, I will describe my long str=
uggle for elementary wisdom and a brief summary of my ending notions. After=
 that, I will give examples, many quite vivid and interesting to me, of bot=
h psychology at work and antidotes to psychology-based dysfunction. Then I =
will end by asking and answering some general questions raised by what I ha=
ve said. This will be a long talk.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Whe=
n I started law practice, I had respect for the power of genetic evolution =
and an appreciation of man=E2=80=99s many evolution-based resemblances to l=
ess cognitively gifted animals and insects. I was aware that man was a soci=
al animal, greatly and automatically influenced by behavior he observed in =
men around him. I also knew that man lived, like barnyard animals and monke=
ys, in limited-size dominance hierarchies, wherein he tended to respect aut=
hority and to like and cooperate with his own hierarchy members while displ=
aying considerable distrust and dislike for competing men not in his own hi=
erarchy.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">But this generalized, evoluti=
on-based theory structure was inadequate to enable me to cope properly with=
 the cognition I encountered. I was soon surrounded by much extreme irratio=
nality, displayed in patterns and subpatterns. So surrounded, I could see t=
hat I was not going to cope as well as I wished with life unless I could ac=
quire a better theory-structure on which to hang my observations and experi=
ences.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 hMWUtG"><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea0=

"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">By then, my craving for more theory had a long histo=
ry. Partly, I had always loved theory as an aid in puzzle-solving and as a =
means of satisfying my monkey-like curiosity. And partly, I had found that =
theory-structure was a superpower in helping one get what one wanted, as I =
had early discovered in school, wherein I had excelled without labor, guide=
d by theory, while many others, without mastery of theory, failed despite m=
onstrous effort. Better theory, I thought, had always worked for me, and, i=
f now available, could make me acquire capital and independence faster and =
better assist everything I loved. So I slowly developed my own system of ps=
ychology, more or less in the self-help style of Ben Franklin and with the =
determination displayed in the refrain of the nursery story: =E2=80=9C=E2=

proach that, when two things were inextricably intertwined and interconnect=

 I tried any such restricted approach, that I would end up, in the immortal=

tely responds by cooperating with other ants in carrying the dead body out =
of the hive. Harvard=E2=80=99s great E.=E2=80=8AO. Wilson performed one of =
the best psychology experiments ever done when he painted dead ant pheromon=

of responses that generally work out all right but which are imprudently us=

 of ant demonstrates that the limited brain of ants can be misled by circum=

walking, to follow the ant ahead. And when these ants stumble into walking =
in a big circle, they sometimes walk round and round until they perish.</p>=

neral Electric, wanted to expand profits from loans to outsiders. Under Wes=
tinghouse=E2=80=99s accounting practice, provisions for future credit losse=
s on these loans depended largely on the past credit experience of its lend=
ing subsidiary, which mainly made loans unlikely to cause massive losses.</=
p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Now, there are two special classes of l=
oans that naturally cause much trouble for lenders. The first is 95-percent=
-of-value construction loans to any kind of real estate developer, and the =
second is any kind of construction loan on a hotel. So, naturally, if one w=
as willing to loan approximately 95 percent of the real cost to a developer=
 constructing a hotel, the loan would bear a much higher than normal intere=
st rate because the credit loss danger would be much higher than normal. So=
, sound accounting for Westinghouse in making a big, new mass of 95-percent=
-of-value construction loans to hotel developers would have been to report =
almost no profit, or even a loss, on each loan until, years later, the loan=
 became clearly worth par.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">But Westing=
house instead plunged into big-time construction lending on hotels, using a=
ccounting that made its lending officers look good because it showed extrem=
ely high starting income from loans that were very inferior to the loans fr=
om which the company had suffered small credit losses in the past. This ter=
rible accounting was allowed by both international and outside accountants =
for Westinghouse as they displayed the conduct predicted by the refrain =E2=
=80=9CWhose bread I eat, his song I sing.=E2=80=9D The result was billions =
of dollars of losses.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Who was at fault=
? The guy from the refrigerator division, or some similar division, who as =
lending officer was suddenly in charge of loans to hotel developers? Or the=
 accountants and other senior people who tolerated a nearly insane incentiv=
e structure, almost sure to trigger incentive-caused bias in a lending offi=
cer? My answer puts the most blame on the accountants and other senior peop=
le who created the accounting system. These people became the equivalent of=
 an armored car cash-carrying service that suddenly decided to dispense wit=
h vehicles and have unarmed children hand-carry its customers=E2=80=99 cash=
 in open bushel baskets.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I wish I coul=
d tell you that this sort of thing no longer happens, but this is not so. A=
fter Westinghouse blew up, General Electric=E2=80=99s Kidder Peabody subsid=
iary put a silly computer program in place that allowed a bond trader to sh=
ow immense fictional profits. And after that, much accounting became even w=
orse, perhaps reaching its nadir at Enron.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXN=
Ucv">So incentive-caused bias is a huge, important thing, with highly impor=
tant antidotes, like the cash register and a sound accounting system. But w=
hen I came years ago to the psychology texts, I found that, while they were=
 about 1,000 pages long, there was little therein that dealt with incentive=
-caused bias and no mention of Patterson or sound accounting systems.</p><p=
 class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Somehow incentive-caused bias and its antid=
otes pretty well escaped the standard survey courses in psychology, even th=
ough incentive-caused bias had long been displayed prominently in much of t=
he world=E2=80=99s great literature, and antidotes to it had long existed i=
n standard business routines. In the end, I concluded that when something w=
as obvious in life but not easily demonstrable in certain kinds of easy-to-=
do, repeatable academic experiments, the truffle hounds of psychology very =
often missed it.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In some cases, other =
disciplines showed more interest in psychological tendencies than did psych=
ology, at least as explicated in psychology textbooks. For instance, econom=
ists, speaking from the employer=E2=80=99s point of view, have long had a n=
ame for the natural results of incentive-caused bias: agency cost.</p><bloc=

jXNUcv">As the name implies, economists have typically known that, just as =
grain is always lost to rats, employers always lose to employees who improp=
erly think of themselves first. Employer-installed antidotes include tough =
internal audit systems and severe public punishment for identified miscrean=
ts, as well as misbehavior-preventing routines and such machines as cash re=
gisters. From the employee=E2=80=99s point of view, incentive-caused bias q=
uite naturally causes opposing abuse from the employer: the sweatshop, the =
unsafe workplace, etc. And these bad results for employees have antidotes n=
ot only in pressure from unions but also in government action, such as wage=
 and hour laws, workplace safety rules, measures fostering unionization, an=
d workers=E2=80=99 compensation systems. Given the opposing psychology-indu=
ced strains that naturally occur in employment because of incentive-caused =
bias on both sides of the relationship, it is no wonder the Chinese are so =
much into yin and yang.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The inevitable=
 ubiquity of incentive-caused bias has vast, generalized consequences. For =
instance, a sales force living only on commissions will be much harder to k=
eep moral than one under less pressure from the compensation arrangement. O=
n the other hand, a purely commissioned sales force may well be more effici=
ent per dollar spent. Therefore, difficult decisions involving trade-offs a=
re common in creating compensation arrangements in the sales function.</p><=
p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The extreme success of free-market capital=
ism as an economic system owes much to its prevention of many bad effects f=
rom incentive-caused bias. Most capitalist owners in a vast web of free-mar=
ket economic activity are selected for ability by surviving in a brutal com=
petition with other owners and have a strong incentive to prevent all waste=
 in operations within their ownership. After all, they live on the differen=
ce between their competitive prices and their overall costs, and their busi=
nesses will perish if costs exceed sales. Replace such owners by salaried e=
mployees of the state and you will normally get a substantial reduction in =
overall efficiency, as each employee who replaces an owner is subject to in=
centive-caused bias as he determines what service he will give in exchange =
for his salary and how much he will yield to peer pressure from many fellow=
 employees who do not desire his creation of any strong performance model.<=
/p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Another generalized consequence of inc=
entive-caused bias is that man tends to game all human systems, often displ=
aying great ingenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others. =
Anti-gaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary part of al=
most all system design.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Also needed in=
 system design is an admonition: Dread, and avoid as much you can, rewardin=

 of behavior and efficiency, as well as the incurrence of unfair costs and =
wealth transfers. If education were improved, with psychological reality be=

out of our legislatures and courts.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 h=

exchangeable for a banana. So it is with humans working for money=E2=80=94o=
nly more so, because human money is exchangeable for many desired things in=
 addition to food, and one ordinarily gains status from either holding or s=
pending it. Moreover, a rich person will often, through habit, work or conn=
ive energetically for more money long after he has almost no real need for =
more. Averaged out, money is a mainspring of modern civilization, having li=
ttle precedent in the behavior of nonhuman animals. Money rewards are also =
intertwined with other forms of reward. For instance, some people use money=
 to buy status, and others use status to get money, while still others sort=
 of do both things at the same time.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">A=

 Few people demonstrated this process better than Ben Franklin. As he was r=

<p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Given the psychology-based hostility natu=

nto distinct and different patterns. As the waters of the flood came up and=
 receded, many dogs reached a point where they had almost no airspace betwe=

stress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed that many of the dogs were n=

now disliked him, for example.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">This re=

"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I will make a few tentative suggestions. Maybe many =
of the long-dead professors wanted to create a whole science from one narro=
w type of repeatable psychology experiment that was conductible in a univer=
sity setting and that aimed at one psychological tendency at a time. If so,=
 these early psychology professors made a massive error in so restricting t=
heir approach to their subject. It would be like physics ignoring 1) astrop=
hysics because it couldn=E2=80=99t happen in a physics lab, plus 2) all com=
pound effects.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">What psychological tend=
encies could account for early psychology professors adopting an over-restr=
icted approach to their own subject matter? One candidate would be availabi=
lity-misweighing tendency grounded in a preference for easy-to-control data=
. And then the restrictions would eventually create an extreme case of man-=
with-a-hammer tendency. Another candidate might be envy/jealousy tendency, =
through which early psychology professors displayed some weird form of envy=
 of a physics that was misunderstood. This possibility tends to demonstrate=
 that leaving envy/jealousy out of academic psychology was never a good ide=
a.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I now quitclaim all these historica=

6e5ea00-9 ghyoaX">Questions and answers</h4><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUc=
v">Now, as promised, I will ask and answer a few general questions.</p><p c=
lass=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">My first is a compound question: Isn=E2=80=99=
t this list of psychological tendencies tautological to some extent compare=
d to the system of Euclid? That is, aren=E2=80=99t there overlaps in the te=
ndencies? And couldn=E2=80=99t the system be laid out just as plausibly in =
a somewhat different way? The answers are yes, yes, and yes, but this matte=
rs only moderately. Further refinement of these tendencies, while desirable=
, has a limited practical potential because a significant amount of messine=
ss is unfixable in a soft science like psychology.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea=
00-5 jXNUcv">My second question is: Can you supply a real-world model, inst=
ead of a Milgram-type controlled psychology experiment, that uses your syst=
em to illustrate multiple psychological tendencies interacting in a plausib=
ly diagnosable way? The answer is yes. One of my favorite cases involves th=
e McDonnell Douglas airliner evacuation test.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 =
jXNUcv">Before a new airliner can be sold, the government requires that it =
pass an evacuation test, during which a full load of passengers must get ou=
t in some short period of time. The government directs that the test be rea=
listic, so you can=E2=80=99t pass by evacuating only 20-year-old athletes. =
So McDonnell Douglas scheduled such a test in a darkened hangar using a lot=
 of old people as evacuees. The passenger cabin was, say, 20 feet above the=
 concrete floor of the hangar and was to be evacuated through moderately fl=
imsy rubber chutes. The first test was made in the morning. There were abou=
t 20 very serious injuries, and the evacuation took so long it flunked the =
time test. So what did McDonnell Douglas next do? It repeated the test in t=
he afternoon, and this time there was another failure, with about 20 more s=
erious injuries, including one case of permanent paralysis.</p><p class=3D"=
sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">What psychological tendencies contributed to this ter=
rible result? Well, using my tendency list as a checklist, I come up with t=
he following explanation.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Reward-super=
response tendency drove McDonnell Douglas to act fast. It couldn=E2=80=99t =
sell its airliner until it passed the test. Also pushing the company was do=
ubt-avoidance tendency, with its natural drive to arrive at a decision and =
run with it. Then the government=E2=80=99s direction that the test be reali=
stic drove authority-misinfluence tendency into the mischief of causing McD=
onnell Douglas to overreact by using what was obviously too dangerous a tes=
t method. By now the course of action had been decided, so inconsistency-av=
oidance tendency helped preserve the near-idiotic plan. When all the old pe=
ople got to the dark hangar, with its high airline cabin and concrete floor=
, the situation must have made McDonnell Douglas employees very queasy, but=
 they saw other employees and supervisors not objecting. Social-proof tende=
ncy, therefore, swamped the queasiness. This allowed continued action as pl=
anned, a continuation that was aided by more authority-misinfluence tendenc=
y.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Then came the disaster of the morni=
ng test with its failure, plus serious injuries. McDonnell Douglas ignored =
the strong disconfirming evidence from the failure of the first test becaus=
e confirmation bias, aided by the triggering of a strong deprival-superreac=
tion tendency, favored maintaining the original plan. McDonnell Douglas=E2=
=80=99s deprival-suppereaction tendency was now like that which causes a ga=
mbler, bent on getting even after a huge loss, to make his final big bet. A=
fter all, McDonnell Douglas was going to lose a lot if it didn=E2=80=99t pa=
ss its test as scheduled.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">More psychol=
ogy-based explanation can probably be made, but the foregoing discussion is=
 complete enough to demonstrate the utility of my system when used in a che=
cklist mode.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">My third question is also=
 compound: In the practical world, what good is the thought system laid out=
 in this list of tendencies? Isn=E2=80=99t practical benefit prevented beca=
use these psychological tendencies are so thoroughly programmed into the hu=
man mind by broad evolution=E2=80=94the combination of genetic and cultural=
 evolution=E2=80=94that we can=E2=80=99t get rid of them?</p><p class=3D"sc=
-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">Well, the answer is that the tendencies are probably mu=
ch more good than bad. Otherwise, they wouldn=E2=80=99t be there, working p=
retty well for man, given his condition and his limited brain capacity. So =
the tendencies can=E2=80=99t be simply washed out automatically, and should=
n=E2=80=99t be. Nevertheless, the psychological thought system described, w=
hen properly understood and used, enables the spread of wisdom and good con=
duct and facilitates the avoidance of disaster. Tendency is not always dest=

trouble that would otherwise occur.</p><blockquote class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-4 h=

as being manipulated by a practiced routine, and I just loved it. I never s=

her I was rational. You=E2=80=99ll have to judge yourself whether that=E2=
=80=99s true. I may be demonstrating some psychological tendency I hadn=E2=
=80=99t planned on demonstrating.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">My f=
ifth question is: Don=E2=80=99t we need more reconciliation of psychology a=
nd economics? My answer is yes, and I suspect that some slight progress is =
being made. I have heard of one such example: Colin Camerer of Caltech, who=
 works in experimental economics, devised an interesting experiment in whic=
h he caused high-IQ students, playing for real money, to pay price A + B fo=
r a =E2=80=9Csecurity=E2=80=9D they knew would turn into A dollars at the e=
nd of the day. This foolish action occurred because the students were allow=
ed to trade with each other in a liquid market for the security. Some stude=
nts then paid price A + B because they hoped to unload on other students at=
 a higher price before the day was over.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUc=
v">What I will now confidently predict is that, despite Camerer=E2=80=99s e=
xperimental outcome, most economics and corporate finance professors who st=
ill believe in the hard-form efficient market hypothesis will retain their =
original belief. If so, this will be one more indication of how irrational =
smart people can be when influenced by psychological tendencies.</p><p clas=
s=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">My sixth question is: Don=E2=80=99t moral and pr=
udential problems come with knowledge of these psychological tendencies? Th=
e answer is yes. For instance, psychological knowledge improves persuasive =
power, and, like other powers, it can be used for good or ill. Captain Cook=
 once played a psychology-based trick on his seamen to cause them to eat sa=
uerkraut and avoid scurvy. In my opinion, this action was both ethical and =
wise under the circumstances, despite the deliberate manipulation involved.=
</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">But ordinarily, when you try to use y=
our knowledge of psychological tendencies in the artful manipulation of som=
eone whose trust you need, you will be making both a moral and prudential e=
rror. The moral error is obvious. The prudential error comes because many i=
ntelligent people, targeted for conscious manipulation, are likely to figur=

sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">Born in Marton, England, James Cook (1728=E2=80=93177=

>Talk Eleven Revisited</h3><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In this talk, =
made in 2000, I gave favorable mention to Judith Rich Harris=E2=80=99s stro=
ng-selling book <i>The Nurture Assumption.</i> You will recall that this wo=
rk demonstrated that peer pressure on the young is far more important, and =
parental nurture much less important, than had been commonly recognized.</p=
><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The success of the book, with its vast p=
ractical implications, has an interesting story behind it. Long before the =
book was published, Harris was kicked out of Harvard=E2=80=99s PhD program =
in psychology because Harvard believed that she lacked qualities ideal in p=
sychological research. Then, later, out of illness and obscurity, as she wa=
s pretty much housebound throughout adult life by unfixable autoimmune dise=
ase, she published an academic paper on which her subsequent book was based=
. And for that paper she won a prestigious medal, named after the man who s=
igned her dismissal notice from Harvard, awarded annually by the American P=
sychological Association for distinction in published writing.</p><p class=
=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">When I learned from her impressive book that this=
 ironic result had occurred, I wrote to Harvard, my alma mater, urging it t=
o award Harris, whom I did not know, an honorary PhD=E2=80=94or, better yet=
, a real PhD. I cited the example of Oxford. That great university once all=
owed its best student, Samuel Johnson, to leave without a degree because he=
 was too poor to continue paying tuition. But Oxford later made gracious am=
ends. It gave Johnson a doctorate after he conquered sickness and became fa=
mous in a tough climb once described in his own words: =E2=80=9CSlow rises =
worth, by poverty oppressed.=E2=80=9D</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">=
I failed utterly in my effort to convince Harvard to imitate Oxford in this=
 way. But Harvard did later recruit from MIT one of the most famous living =
psychology professors, Steven Pinker, and Pinker is a big admirer of Harris=
. From this step, we can see one reason why its liberal arts division is mo=
re highly regarded than most others. The division=E2=80=99s extreme depth o=
ften allows partial correction of bonehead errors that would flourish unopp=
osed elsewhere.</p><aside class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-2 gQrWhU">Born in Montreal i=
n 1954, Steven Pinker earned a degree in experimental psychology at McGill =
University and then moved on to Harvard for his doctorate. He has taught at=
 Harvard and MIT at various times and is currently the Johnstone family pro=
fessor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard. Pinker is interested in =
language and the mind, including the field of visual cognition, which encom=
passes the ability to imagine shapes and recognize faces and objects. He sp=
ecializes in language development in children and has written many importan=
t papers and books on this and other topics.</aside><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00=
-5 jXNUcv">In 2006, Harris, struggling further through her unfixable illnes=
s, published another book, <i>No Two Alike.</i> The title is apt because on=
e central question the author assaults is why identical twins turn out to b=
e so different in important aspects of personality. Her dogged curiosity an=
d rigor in dealing with this question remind me of both Darwin and Sherlock=
 Holmes. And her solution is very plausible, as she collects and explains d=
ata from professional literature, including an interesting case wherein one=
 of two identical twins became a success in business and family life while =
the other twin went to Skid Row.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">I won=
=E2=80=99t here disclose Harris=E2=80=99s desirably generalized answer to h=
er central question, because it would be better for <i>Almanack </i>readers=
 to first guess the answer, then read her book. If Harris is roughly right,=
 which seems very likely to me, she has twice, from a very handicapped posi=
tion, produced academic insights of great practical importance in child-rea=
ring, education, and much else.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">How co=
uld this rare and desirable result happen? Well, by Harris=E2=80=99s own ac=
count, she was =E2=80=9Cimpertinent and skeptical, even as a child,=E2=80=
=9D and these qualities, plus patient, determined skill, have obviously ser=
ved her truth-seeking well, all the way through to age 67. No doubt she was=
 also assisted by her enthusiasm in destroying her own ideas, as she now de=
monstrates by apologizing for her former work as a textbook writer who repe=
ated wrong notions, now outgrown.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">In t=
his talk I displayed some impertinency of my own by delivering an extreme-s=
ounding message. It claims nothing less than that 1) academic psychology is=
 hugely important, 2) even so, it is usually ill-thought-out and ill-presen=
ted by its PhD denizens, and 3) my way of presenting psychology often has a=
 large superiority in practical utility compared to most textbooks. Natural=
ly, I believe these extreme claims are correct. After all, I assembled the =
material contained in this talk to help me succeed in practical thinking an=
d not to gain advantage by making public any would-be clever notions.</p><p=

p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">This book is a survey of Charles T. Munger=
: his approach to learning, decision-making, investing, his speeches, his z=
ingers, and more. The impetus for the book came from the many people who, o=
ver the years, have said they wished one existed=E2=80=94and have done so w=
ith ever-increasing vigor at Berkshire and Wesco shareholder meetings, at d=
inner parties, on message boards, and many other places. Hearing this clamo=
r, your editor, Peter Kaufman, suggested to Warren Buffett that a book be d=
one and was encouraged to take it upon himself to make it happen.</p><p cla=
ss=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">The production team included Charles Belser, De=
bbie Bosanek, Michael Broggie, Carl Foote, Travis Gallup, Paul Hartman, Eri=
c Hartman-Birge, Marcus Kaufman, Peter Kaufman, Pamela Koch, Carol Loomis, =
Steve Mull, Doerthe Obert, Scott Rule, Whitney Tilson, Dwight Tompkins, and=
 Ed Wexler.</p><p class=3D"sc-96e5ea00-5 jXNUcv">If you enjoy reading <i>Po=
or Charlie=E2=80=99s Almanack</i> half as much as we enjoyed putting it tog=
ether, we will consider our efforts a distinct success. In every respect, b=
ut particularly in our interactions with Charlie, his family, and the Munge=
rs=E2=80=99 wide circle of friends and associates, we have been favored wit=
h calm skies and smooth sailing in the production of this book. We hope our=
 efforts have proven worthy of our subject, a good and admirable man.</p><h=
