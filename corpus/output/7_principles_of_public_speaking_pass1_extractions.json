      "summary": "Richard Zeoli outlines seven principles for effective public speaking: Perception (authenticity and preparation), Perfection (handling mistakes gracefully), Visualization (mental rehearsal), Discipline (consistent practice), Description (storytelling over data), Inspiration (serving the audience), and Anticipation (brevity and impact).
