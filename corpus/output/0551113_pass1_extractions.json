      "summary": "This book review examines Jerome Groopman's 'How Doctors Think,' which analyzes diagnostic and treatment decision-making in medicine through case studies of both errors and successes. The reviewer highlights the book's identification of common cognitive biases in clinical practice while noting its limitation in not quantifying the prevalence of such errors.",

        "Finding something satisfactory in diagnosis is not equivalent to finding everything necessary",
