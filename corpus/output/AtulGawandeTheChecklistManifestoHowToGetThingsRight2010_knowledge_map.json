  "document_summary": "The Checklist Manifesto explores how modern professionals across fields\u2014medicine, aviation, construction, finance\u2014struggle not with ignorance but with ineptitude: the failure to correctly apply existing knowledge in increasingly complex environments. Through case studies ranging from surgical errors to plane crashes to Hurricane Katrina, Gawande demonstrates that simple, well-designed checklists serve as cognitive nets that catch mental flaws, distribute responsibility across teams, and enable systematic management of complexity. The book traces how checklists evolved from 1930s aviation to become proven interventions that reduced surgical complications by 36% and deaths by 47% across eight global hospitals, yet remain resisted by professional cultures that prize individual autonomy over disciplined teamwork.",
