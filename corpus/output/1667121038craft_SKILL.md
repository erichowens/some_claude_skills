# Academic Research Craft
Transform topics into consequential problems, then into arguments that advance scholarly understanding through iterative inquiry and ethical practice.

## When to Use
✅ Use for: Academic papers, theses, dissertations, scholarly articles, grant proposals, literature reviews, conference presentations
❌ NOT for: Journalism, creative nonfiction, opinion pieces, business reports, technical documentation without argumentation

## Core Process

### Phase 1: Topic → Problem Transformation
```
START: Subject area of interest
  ↓
NARROW to specific topic (4-5 words with action-derived nouns)
  ↓
FORMULATE questions (prioritize "how" and "why" over "who/what/when/where")
  ↓
APPLY "So what?" test
  │
  ├─→ [No clear consequence] → REFORMULATE question
  │
  └─→ [Consequence identified] → FRAME problem
                                   ↓
                        "I am studying X (topic)
                         because I want to find out Y (question)
                         in order to help readers understand Z (consequence)"
                                   ↓
                        DECISION: Problem type?
                        ├─→ PRACTICAL: Tangible costs (time/money/security)
                        │              → Solution enables action
                        │
                        └─→ CONCEPTUAL: Understanding gap
                                       → Solution enables comprehension
                                   ↓
                        VERIFY: Does reader care about Z?
                        ├─→ NO → Return to "So what?" test
                        └─→ YES → PROCEED to argument construction
```

### Phase 2: Argument Construction
```
START: Problem statement + preliminary solution
  ↓
STATE main CLAIM as specifically as possible
  ↓
IDENTIFY supporting REASONS (assertions from mind)
  ↓
For EACH reason:
  ├─→ FIND EVIDENCE (data from world, made visible)
  ├─→ TEST sufficiency: Accurate? Precise? Representative? Authoritative?
  └─→ ANTICIPATE reader objections
          ↓
  DECISION: How strong is counterargument?
  ├─→ WEAK → REFUTE with evidence
  ├─→ MODERATE → ACKNOWLEDGE + LIMIT claim scope
  └─→ STRONG → CONCEDE + REVISE claim
          ↓
DECISION: Is warrant connecting reason→claim obvious?
  ├─→ YES → Leave tacit
  └─→ NO → STATE explicitly (general circumstance + general consequence)
          ↓
STORYBOARD: 
  - Write claim + reasons on separate cards
  - List evidence below each reason
  - Arrange logically (not chronologically)
  - Read reasons alone → verify logical flow
          ↓
IDENTIFY gaps → Return to evidence gathering
          ↓
DECISION: Key terms from claim run through ALL sections?
  ├─→ NO → RESTRUCTURE or DISCARD unconnected sections
  └─→ YES → PROCEED to drafting
```

### Phase 3: Source Engagement
```
BEFORE any notes:
  ↓
RECORD complete bibliographic information
  ↓
READ source TWICE:
  1st pass: GENEROUS reading (understand claims + reasoning)
  2nd pass: CRITICAL reading (test validity + limitations)
  ↓
For EACH note:
  ↓
CLASSIFY source relationship to YOUR project:
  ├─→ PRIMARY: Original data closest to phenomenon
  ├─→ SECONDARY: Analysis of primary sources
  └─→ TERTIARY: Synthesis (use for exploration only, don't cite)
  ↓
DECISION: How to capture content?
  ├─→ QUOTE: Copy EXACTLY, mark with "" IMMEDIATELY, use when:
  │          - Precise wording matters
  │          - Authority needs attribution
  │          - You'll analyze the language itself
  │
  ├─→ PARAPHRASE: Read → look away → think → write from memory → check
  │                Use when: Ideas matter more than wording
  │
  └─→ SUMMARIZE: Condense main points in your words
  ↓
MARK distinction between:
  - Source material (quotation marks or citation)
  - Your analysis (different color/bracket/indentation)
  ↓
RECORD not just conclusions but REASONING that supports them
  ↓
NOTE whether claim is central argument or minor qualification
```

### Phase 4: Top-Down Revision
```
DRAFT complete → LET COOL (hours to days)
  ↓
LEVEL 1 - GLOBAL STRUCTURE:
  ├─→ Does introduction establish problem readers care about?
  ├─→ Does each major section support one reason?
  ├─→ Do key terms from claim appear throughout?
  └─→ Does conclusion answer "So what?" question?
      │
      └─→ [Structure fails] → REWRITE before proceeding
  ↓
LEVEL 2 - SECTION ORGANIZATION:
  ├─→ Are transitions between sections clear?
  ├─→ Is evidence-to-explanation ratio ≥1:3?
  └─→ Are counterarguments acknowledged and addressed?
  ↓
LEVEL 3 - PARAGRAPH COHERENCE:
  ├─→ Does each paragraph have one main point?
  ├─→ Is point at beginning OR end (not buried in middle)?
  └─→ Do sentences within paragraph connect logically?
  ↓
LEVEL 4 - SENTENCE CLARITY:
  ├─→ Are subjects concrete and characters visible?
  ├─→ Are key actions in verbs (not nominalizations)?
  └─→ Are hedges appropriate (probably/may) not arrogant (clearly/obviously)?
  ↓
LEVEL 5 - PROOFREADING:
  ├─→ Spelling/punctuation correct?
  ├─→ Citations complete and accurate?
  └─→ Quotations marked and attributed?
```

## Anti-Patterns

### The Data Dump
**Novice approach:** "I'll collect all available information on my topic, then figure out what it means. More sources = better research."

**Expert approach:** "I formulate a specific question first. Questions drive source selection. Without a guiding question, I cannot determine relevance or sufficiency."

**Timeline:** Novices realize around page 15 that they have 47 sources but no coherent argument. Experts storyboard their argument structure before deep research begins.

**Shibboleth:** "You base reasons on evidence; you never base evidence on reasons."

---

### Narrative Organization
**Novice approach:** "I'll organize my paper chronologically: first I looked at X, then I discovered Y, finally I realized Z."

**Expert approach:** "Readers need logical support for claims, not a story of my thinking process. I organize by reasons supporting the main claim, regardless of discovery order."

**Timeline:** Appears in first drafts when writers conflate research process with argument structure. Disappears after first major revision that applies storyboarding.

**Shibboleth:** "Research is zigzagging up a foggy hill through overgrown woods—but readers need a cleared path, not a travelogue."

---

### Arrogant Certainty
**Novice approach:** "I must state my claims with absolute confidence. Acknowledging limitations makes me look weak and uncertain."

**Expert approach:** "Nothing damages ethos more than arrogant certainty. I enhance credibility by modestly acknowledging limits and addressing counterarguments."

**Timeline:** Undergraduate writing uses "clearly" and "obviously" frequently. Graduate writing replaces with "probably," "often," "may." Professional writing explicitly states limiting conditions.

**Shibboleth:** "As paradoxical as it seems, you make your argument stronger and more credible by modestly acknowledging its limits."

---

### Reason-Evidence Confusion
**Novice approach:** "These statistics prove my point" (presenting assertions as if they were data, or treating data as self-explanatory).

**Expert approach:** "Reasons are assertions I think up; evidence is data I find in the world and make visible. Evidence never speaks for itself—I must speak for it."

**Timeline:** Undergraduates accept reasons at face value. Advanced researchers demand: "What evidence grounds that reason?" for every assertion.

**Shibboleth:** "Evidence is only what readers agree not to question. What seems like hard evidence to me may be merely soft reasons to skeptical readers."

---

### Burying the Problem
**Novice approach:** "I find this topic fascinating, so readers will too. The research justifies itself."

**Expert approach:** "Readers judge significance by costs to them, not to me. I must complete: 'I'm studying X because I want to find out Y in order to help readers understand Z.'"

**Timeline:** First research papers answer curiosity. Mature research addresses community-recognized problems with consequential stakes.

**Shibboleth:** "The worst response isn't 'I don't agree' but 'I don't care.' Readers stop asking 'So what?' only when costs are clear."

---

### Close Paraphrasing
**Novice approach:** "I changed some words and rearranged the sentence structure, so it's not plagiarism."

**Expert approach:** "I read the passage, look away, think about what it means, then write from memory. If my wording is too close to the original, I use direct quotation with quotation marks."

**Timeline:** High school research accepts close paraphrasing. College research demands true synthesis. Graduate work requires citation of borrowed reasoning patterns, not just borrowed words.

**Shibboleth:** "If you can't sum up a passage in your mind, you don't understand it well enough to disagree—or to paraphrase."

---

### Bottom-Up Revision
**Novice approach:** "I'll perfect each sentence as I write, then make sure paragraphs flow nicely."

**Expert approach:** "I revise top-down: global structure first, then sections, then paragraphs, then sentences. Perfecting sentences in a flawed structure wastes time."

**Timeline:** Novices spend hours polishing paragraphs they later delete. Experts spend minutes on structural diagnosis before investing in sentence-level revision.

**Shibboleth:** "Let the draft cool before revision—you need fresh eyes to see what you wrote rather than what you meant to write."

## Mental Models

### Research as Millennia-Spanning Conversation
Research is fundamentally social, even when conducted alone. Every source cited invokes voices of past researchers; every claim anticipates future readers. You enter an ongoing conversation through citation and contribution, never starting from scratch.

**Application:** When stuck, ask "Who cares about this question?" and "What would they say?" Imagine specific researchers as your audience.

---

### The Five-Element Argument Architecture
Arguments are buildings: claims rest on reasons, reasons rest on evidence, all must be sound. Warrants are architectural principles connecting floors. Ethos is the builder's reputation—can readers trust the structure you've built?

**Application:** Test argument stability by removing each element. Does the structure collapse? Can readers trace load-bearing reasoning from foundation to roof?

---

### The Two-Part Problem Structure
Every research problem has anatomy: (1) condition of incomplete knowledge, (2) consequences of that gap. Without both parts, you have a topic, not a problem.

**Application:** Complete the three-step formula: "I am studying X because I want to find out Y in order to help readers understand Z." If Z is missing or unconvincing, you haven't yet found a research problem.

---

### Evidence as Constructed Foundation
Evidence seems like bedrock—hard, solid, foundational. But all "evidence" is actually reported, not directly presented. Facts are shaped by collectors and users. What counts as evidence is field-specific and temporally bounded.

**Application:** For every piece of evidence, ask: Who collected this? How? What assumptions enabled this collection? What would a skeptical reader question?

---

### Iterative Zigzagging vs. Linear Path
Research isn't a straight line from topic to conclusion. It's zigzagging up a foggy hill through overgrown woods—you can't see the destination until you arrive, and you loop back repeatedly.

**Application:** When stuck, loop back to earlier stages. Drafting introductions may reveal problems needing more research. Organizing notes may generate new insights. Planning arguments early (while still researching) focuses later inquiry.

## Shibboleths

Core phrases that distinguish insiders from outsiders:

- "Without trustworthy published research, we'd be prisoners of the moment"
- "Those who find new problems often contribute more than those who solve defined ones"
- "You can't really understand what you think until you understand why a rational person might think differently"
- "Facts never speak for themselves, especially not long quotations or complex numbers"
- "Your reputation is the tacit sixth element in every argument you write"
- "When you cite sources fully and accurately, you sustain the sense of community that gives written research both scholarly and social value"

## Field-Specific Variations

### Historical Research
- Originated primary/secondary source distinction (19th century)
- Evidence requires proximity to events + critical evaluation of bias
- Warrants often involve continuity/change principles

### Scientific Research
- Evidence requires reproducibility (replaced witness testimony ~300 years ago)
- Warrants based on natural laws and experimental controls
- Standardized methodology reduces dependence on researcher ethos

### Social Sciences
- Evidence combines quantitative data with interpretive frameworks
- Warrants involve causal mechanisms and representative sampling
- Significance measured by generalizability

### Humanities
- Evidence includes textual analysis and contextual interpretation
- Warrants involve interpretive principles and theoretical frameworks
- Significance measured by explanatory power for meaning-making
