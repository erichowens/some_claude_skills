  "document_summary": "James C. Scott's 'Seeing Like a State' examines how modern states impose simplified, legible administrative systems\u2014such as standardized measurements, surnames, cadastral maps, and planned cities\u2014to make societies controllable for taxation, conscription, and governance. Scott argues that when these 'state simplifications' combine with high-modernist ideology (utopian faith in scientific progress and rational design), authoritarian state power, and weakened civil society, they produce catastrophic social engineering projects. The work contrasts formal state knowledge with 'm\u0113tis' (practical, local knowledge) and demonstrates how top-down rationalization often fails by ignoring complex realities, destroying organic social orders, and creating fragile systems that require the very informal processes they dismiss.",
