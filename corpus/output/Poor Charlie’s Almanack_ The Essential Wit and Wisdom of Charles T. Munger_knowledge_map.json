Munger's wisdom on investing, decision-making, and life, presenting his multidisciplinary approach to worldly wisdom. Munger advocates building a latticework of mental models from diverse academic disciplines\u2014particularly psychology, mathematics, physics, and economics\u2014to achieve superior judgment. His investment philosophy emphasizes patience, discipline, and concentration: waiting for obvious opportunities ('one-foot fences'), making large bets on exceptional businesses with pricing power and ethical management, and holding long-term with minimal turnover. Central to his approach is understanding human psychology and misjudgment tendencies, using inversion (thinking problems backward), staying within circles of competence, and recognizing that ideology, incentive-caused bias, and narrow specialization impair cognition. The book demonstrates that Berkshire Hathaway's extraordinary success came not from constant activity but from approximately ten major insights across two lifetimes, combined with extreme selectivity, intellectual humility about knowledge limits, and systematic avoidance of mistakes through checklists and multidisciplinary analysis.\",\n\n  \"core_concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\":
