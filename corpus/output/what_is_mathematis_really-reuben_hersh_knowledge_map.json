  "document_summary": "Reuben Hersh's 'What Is Mathematics, Really?' proposes a humanist philosophy of mathematics that views it as a social-historical-cultural activity rather than abstract Platonic objects or formal symbol systems. Challenging the traditional dominance of Platonism, formalism, and foundationism, Hersh argues that mathematical objects are social entities existing in shared consciousness, mathematical knowledge is fallible like other knowledge, and proof serves different purposes (convincing in research, explaining in teaching) rather than providing absolute certainty. The book traces how mathematics philosophy has been entangled with theology from Pythagoras through Kant, examines how actual mathematical practice contradicts inherited philosophical dogmas, and demonstrates that the 'front' (formal presentation) and 'back' (creative process) of mathematics reveal mathematics as human activity that grows through problem-solving rather than deduction from eternal axioms.",
