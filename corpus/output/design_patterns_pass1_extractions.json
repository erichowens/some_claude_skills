      "summary": "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems in object-oriented software, organized by purpose (creational, structural, behavioral) and scope (class or object). The Facade pattern exemplifies how patterns provide higher-level interfaces to complex subsystems while maintaining loose coupling between components.",
      "key_claims": [
        "A design pattern has 4 essential elements: pattern name, problem, solution, and consequences",
        "Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes customized to solve general design problems in particular contexts",
        "Creational patterns concern object creation, structural patterns deal with composition, behavioral patterns characterize interaction and responsibility distribution",
        "An object's internal state is encapsulated and cannot be accessed directly from outside",
        "Interfaces are fundamental in object-oriented systems; objects are only known through their interface",
        "Programming to an interface rather than implementation allows clients to remain unaware of specific object types",
        "Object composition is an alternative to class inheritance that is defined dynamically at run-time",
        "Class inheritance breaks encapsulation by exposing subclass to parent implementation details",
        "An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its code structure",
        "Loose coupling increases the probability that a class can be reused in isolation",
        "The Facade pattern provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem and decouples subsystem from clients"
      ],
      "processes": [
        "Specifying object interfaces by identifying key elements and types of data sent across interfaces",
        "Relating run-time and compile-time structures by designing object and type relationships with care",
        "Using abstract coupling and layering techniques to promote loosely coupled systems",
        "Facade forwards client requests to appropriate subsystem objects after translating its interface to subsystem interfaces"
      ],
      "decisions": [
        "When to apply a pattern is described in the 'problem' element",
        "Choose between class inheritance and object composition based on flexibility and encapsulation needs",
        "Favor object composition over class inheritance to keep each class encapsulated and focused",
        "Design patterns should only be applied when the flexibility they afford is actually needed",
        "Use delegation as a way to make composition as powerful for reuse as inheritance"
      ],
      "failures": [
        "Tight coupling between classes makes them hard to reuse in isolation",
        "Tight coupling leads to monolithic systems where you cannot change or remove a class without understanding many others",
        "Inheritance breaks encapsulation by exposing subclass to parent implementation details",
        "Implementation dependencies in inheritance limit flexibility and reusability",
        "Design patterns introduce additional levels of indirection that can complicate design and cost performance",
        "Indiscriminate application of design patterns can overcomplicate a design"
      ],
      "aha_moments": [
        "An object-oriented program's run-time structure often bears little resemblance to its code structure",
        "Programming to an interface rather than implementation fundamentally changes how clients interact with objects",
        "Loose coupling boosts the likelihood that one class of object can cooperate with several others",
        "Delegation enables composition to be as powerful for reuse as inheritance"
      ],
      "metaphors": [
        "Pattern name is a 'handle' for describing design problems and solutions at a higher level of abstraction",
        "Objects 'package' both data and procedures that operate on that data",
        "Facade 'shields' clients from subsystem components"
      ],
      "temporal": [
        "Before: class inheritance defined statically at compile-time with tight coupling; After: object composition defined dynamically at run-time allows substitution and loose coupling",
        "Before: code structure frozen at compile-time; After: run-time structure consists of rapidly changing network of communicating objects"
      ],
      "quotes": [
        "inheritance breaks encapsulation",
        "clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use, as long as the objects adhere to the interface that clients expect",
