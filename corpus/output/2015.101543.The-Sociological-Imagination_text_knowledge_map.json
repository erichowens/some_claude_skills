Wright Mills' 'The Sociological Imagination' is a foundational critique of mid-20th century American social science and a manifesto for a more engaged, historically-grounded approach to understanding society. Mills introduces the 'sociological imagination' as a quality of mind that connects personal troubles to public issues and individual biography to historical forces, enabling people to understand how their private lives intersect with larger structural transformations. The book systematically critiques two dominant trends in social science: 'Grand Theory' (exemplified by Talcott Parsons), which produces abstract, unintelligible formalism divorced from empirical reality, and 'Abstracted Empiricism,' which fetishizes methodology and produces trivial findings disconnected from significant social problems. Mills argues that both approaches serve bureaucratic and ideological interests rather than genuine understanding, and advocates instead for 'classic social analysis'\u2014comparative, historical, structural inquiry focused on the interplay of biography, history, and social structure. He insists that meaningful social science must be problem-centered rather than method-centered, historically specific rather than trans-historical, comparative across societies and time periods, and explicitly aware of its moral and political dimensions. The work is simultaneously a methodological treatise, a political intervention, and a defense of intellectual craftsmanship against the bureaucratization of knowledge.\",\n\n  \"core_concepts\": [\n
