  "document_summary": "Jerome Groopman's 'How Doctors Think' examines the cognitive processes underlying medical diagnostic and treatment decision-making through detailed case studies of both successful diagnoses and clinical errors. The book identifies systematic cognitive biases that affect physician judgment\u2014including commission bias, satisfaction of search, availability error, anchoring error, and attribution error\u2014while emphasizing that language and contextual understanding remain fundamental to clinical practice despite technological advances. A key contribution is highlighting the gap in medical education regarding cognitive error recognition, though the work is limited by not quantifying error prevalence rates.",
