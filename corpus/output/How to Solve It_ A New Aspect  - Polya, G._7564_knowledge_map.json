  "document_summary": "George Polya's 'How to Solve It' presents a systematic, heuristic approach to mathematical problem-solving that revolutionized mathematics education. Originally written in German during the 1930s and published in English in 1945, the book argues that problem-solving is a teachable practical skill acquired through imitation and practice, not just innate talent. Polya introduces a four-phase framework (understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back) supported by general questions and suggestions applicable across all subject matters. The work emphasizes that mathematics has two faces\u2014the rigorous Euclidean deductive science and the experimental, inductive science of discovery\u2014and advocates teaching students the process of mathematical invention ('in statu nascendi') rather than just final solutions. Through teacher-student dialogues, a comprehensive dictionary of heuristic techniques, and practice problems, Polya demonstrates that understanding how solutions are invented develops intellectual abilities and creates lasting engagement with logical thinking.",
