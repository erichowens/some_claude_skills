The book argues that persistent global problems arise from underlying system structures rather than external events or actors, and that understanding feedback loops, stocks, flows, delays, and leverage points enables better intervention in complex systems. Meadows moves from basic concepts (stocks and flows) through common system traps (tragedy of the commons, policy resistance, drift to low performance) to high-leverage intervention points (information flows, rules, paradigms), ultimately arguing that effective system engagement requires 'dancing with systems' through humility, experimentation, and embracing complexity rather than attempting rigid control.\",\n\n  \"core_concepts\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\": \"System Structure\",\n      \"definition\": \"The arrangement of elements, interconnections, and purposes that determines system behavior independent of external events.
