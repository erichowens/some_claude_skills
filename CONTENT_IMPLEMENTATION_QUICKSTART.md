## The Simplest Starting Point (If Overwhelmed)

**DO THIS FIRST:**

1. **Write ONE blog post** (2 hours)
   - Title: "What Are Claude Code Skills?"
   - Template in CONTENT_STRATEGY.md appendix
   - Publish on Medium or dev.to (for SEO)

2. **Film ONE video** (45 min)
   - Pick your favorite skill
   - Screen record yourself using it (7-10 min)
   - Add title card + CTA
   - Upload to YouTube

3. **Create ONE Twitter thread** (15 min)
   - Introduce the skill
   - Show before/after
   - Link to video

**That's 3 hours. You now have:**
- 1 blog post (gets organic traffic)
- 1 video (YouTube algorithm jumpstart)
- 1 Twitter thread (network discovery)

**Repeat this every week. By month 3, you'll have:**
- 12+ blog posts
- 12+ videos
- 12+ Twitter threads
- 300+ followers
- 1,000+ monthly views

---

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't:** Wait for perfection before publishing
✅ **Do:** Publish, learn, iterate

❌ **Don't:** Try to do everything at once
✅ **Do:** Focus on video + blog + Twitter (the big three)

❌ **Don't:** Post sporadically
✅ **Do:** Stick to a consistent schedule (1 piece per platform per week minimum)

❌ **Don't:** Copy other creators' tone
✅ **Do:** Use your authentic voice (Erich's perspective is your unfair advantage)

❌ **Don't:** Ignore analytics
✅ **Do:** Monthly review (what worked? double down on it)

---

## The Weekly Batch System (Most Sustainable)

**Pick a day. Batch all content for the week.**

### Example: Sunday Evening (3 hours)
1. **Film 2 skill videos** (1 hour)
   - Pick 2 skills
   - Record with ScreenFlow
   - Save both MP4s

2. **Write 1-2 blog posts** (1 hour)
   - Use template
   - Quick edit
   - Queue for Monday/Wednesday publish

3. **Write social content** (1 hour)
   - 1 Twitter thread
   - 1 LinkedIn post
   - 1 email newsletter
   - Save as drafts

**Monday-Friday:** Post content (15 min/day engagement)
**Total time:** 3 hours/week input = 7 pieces of content

---

## Metrics to Track (Monthly)

**Create a simple spreadsheet:**

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |

- Multiple revenue streams (affiliate links, sponsorships, courses)

**The investment:** 3-5 hours/week = 150-250 hours/year = compound growth

---

## Personal Accountability

**Share your goals publicly:**

1. **Tweet:** "Building content for Some Claude Skills. My goal: 500 YouTube subs by day 90. Following up weekly."

2. **Discord pinned message:** "Content roadmap: 48 skill videos by [date]. You'll see updates here."

3. **Email:** Include progress in your newsletter ("Week 3: 150 YouTube subs, 4 blog posts published")

**Why:** Public commitment = higher follow-through rate.

---

## If You Get Stuck

**Video is hard?** → Start with blog + Twitter (easier, still builds authority)

**Blog is hard?** → Transcribe your skill videos into blog posts (minimal writing)

**Community is hard?** → Focus on making great content (community follows good content)

**Overwhelmed?** → Pick ONE platform (e.g., YouTube only) and master it. Add platforms monthly.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read** `CONTENT_STRATEGY.md` (30 min read)
2. **Review** `CONTENT_CALENDAR_90DAYS.md` (identify what resonates)
3. **Copy** template from `SOCIAL_MEDIA_TEMPLATES.md`
4. **Create** your first piece of content this week
5. **Share** with 3 people for feedback
6. **Rinse & repeat**

---

## The Permission You Need

✅ **You have permission to:**
- Make mistakes (first videos will be rough, that's ok)
- Iterate (if something doesn't work, try different angle)
- Be authentic (use your real voice, not corporate speak)
- Ask for help (Discord community will give feedback)
- Start small (1 video is enough to build momentum)

❌ **You don't need:**
- Perfect production value
- Thousands of followers to start
- A complete product
- Professional studio
- Years of experience

**You have 48 skills, founder credibility, and a unique aesthetic. That's enough.**

---

## Your Competitive Advantages

1. **Founder credibility** - You built these tools, not just talking about them
2. **Authentic curation** - 48 curated skills beat 1,000 hyped "AI tools"
3. **Retro aesthetic** - Immediately recognizable, ownable brand
4. **Technical depth** - You can explain the "why" behind decisions
5. **Community building** - Early Discord becomes moat as ecosystem grows

---

## Last Thought

**This isn't about being the loudest creator. It's about being the clearest.**

The Claude Code ecosystem is early. Skills are still new. Most content out there is either hype or jargon.

You can be the creator who explains things clearly, shows real examples, and treats the audience like intelligent professionals.

**That's how you win.**
