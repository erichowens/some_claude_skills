## Notes & Assumptions

### Assumptions Made
- You (Erich) are the content creator (not hiring out)
- You can dedicate 5-7 hours/week to content
- You prefer batching (film 2 videos at once, write 2 blogs at once)
- YouTube is your primary platform (highest ROI for effort)
- Discord is your community hub (owned audience)
- You want organic, sustainable growth (not paid ads as primary strategy)
- You value authenticity over perfection

### If These Don't Match Your Situation
- **"I have more time"** → Increase content velocity (3 videos/week instead of 2)
- **"I have less time"** → Focus on blog only, or video only (start with strongest)
- **"I want to outsource"** → Add editor/social media manager (budget $2-5k/month)
- **"I want paid growth"** → Add LinkedIn ads + YouTube ads (budget $500-1k/month)
- **"I prefer Instagram"** → Replace TikTok clips with Instagram Reels (same content, different platform)

---

## What This Strategy is NOT

❌ **Not a get-rich-quick scheme** - Real growth takes 6-12 months
❌ **Not a guarantee** - It's a framework, your execution matters
❌ **Not for passive creators** - Requires consistent 5-7 hours/week
❌ **Not about maximum followers** - About building engaged community
❌ **Not viral-chasing** - Focus on evergreen, educational content

---

## What This Strategy IS

✅ **Sustainable** - 5-7 hours/week is maintainable indefinitely
✅ **Compound growth** - Each piece builds on previous (not one-off campaigns)
✅ **Data-driven** - Based on research, not guessing
✅ **Platform-specific** - Not one-size-fits-all (each platform strategy is unique)
✅ **Founder-friendly** - Designed for solo creator with deep expertise
✅ **Audience-first** - Growth follows good content, not the reverse

---

## The Underlying Philosophy

> **Build expertise through authentic content that demonstrates real value. Establish community through consistent presence. Become the trusted voice in your niche through depth, not breadth.**

This strategy is built on:
1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Explain things clearly to developers who are busy
2. **Depth over novelty** - Master one skill fully before moving to the next
3. **Consistency over perfection** - Weekly publication beats one perfect post
4. **Community over followers** - 500 engaged members beat 50k inactive followers
5. **Authenticity over optimization** - Your real voice beats optimized personas
