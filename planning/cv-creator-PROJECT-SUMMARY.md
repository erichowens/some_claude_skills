## Architecture Highlights

### Data Flow

```
User Request
    ↓
career-biographer (Interview → CareerProfile JSON)
    ↓
competitive-cartographer (Analysis → PositioningStrategy JSON)
    ↓
cv-creator (Generation → Multiple Formats + ATS Analysis)
    ↓
Output:
- resume.pdf (ATS-compatible)
- resume.docx (editable)
- resume.json (JSON Resume schema)
- resume.html (web version)
- resume.md (source)
- ats-analysis.md (optimization report)
```

### Integration Points

**From career-biographer:**
```typescript
interface CareerProfile {
  name, headline, summary
  timelineEvents: [{date, type, title, description, impact, tags}]
  skills: [{category, name, proficiency, yearsOfExperience}]
  projects: [{name, role, description, technologies, impact, metrics}]
  aspirations: {shortTerm, longTerm, values}
  brand: {targetAudience, keywords, tone, colors}
}
```

**From competitive-cartographer:**
```typescript
interface PositioningStrategy {
  positioning: {headline, differentiators, messaging}
  visualStrategy: {aestheticDirection, avoid, embrace}
  contentStrategy: {topics, tone, depth}
}
```

**Output from cv-creator:**
```typescript
interface ResumeOutput {
  metadata: {version, createdAt, targetRole, atsScore}
  content: {professionalSummary, coreSkills, workExperience, education}
  formatting: {template, font, fontSize, margins, colors}
  optimization: {keywords, keywordDensity, missingKeywords, recommendations}
}
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Three-Skill Orchestration
**Unique Value**: First resume builder to integrate:
- Empathetic career data collection (biographer)
- Strategic competitive positioning (cartographer)
- ATS-optimized multi-format generation (cv-creator)

**Impact**: Resumes that pass ATS screening while strategically differentiating candidates

### 2. ATS Optimization Engine
**Scoring Algorithm**:
- Formatting compliance (30 points)
- Section structure (20 points)
- Content quality (30 points)
- Keyword optimization (20 points)

**Result**: Measurable, actionable optimization recommendations

### 3. Content Transformation Intelligence
**Bullet Point Formula**:
```
[Action Verb] + [What you did] + [How/Why] + [Quantifiable Result]
```

**Example Transformation**:
```
Before: "Worked on backend systems"
After:  "Led microservices migration reducing API latency by 40%
         and serving 12M daily users"
```

### 4. Strategic Positioning Application
**From Generic to Differentiated**:
- Generic: "Experienced senior engineer"
- Positioned: "Architect-leader bridging technical depth with business impact"

**Based on**: Competitive cartographer's white space analysis
