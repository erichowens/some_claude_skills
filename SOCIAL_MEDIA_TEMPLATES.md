# Some Claude Skills: Social Media Templates & Posting Guide

**Repurpose video content across platforms systematically.**

---

## Overview: The Content Multiplication System

**One skill spotlight video (7-12 min) → 6 pieces of social content**

```
1 YouTube Video (7-12 min)
├─ 3 YouTube Shorts (15-45 sec each)
├─ 1 Twitter thread (400 words, 3-5 tweets)
├─ 3 LinkedIn posts (micro-updates with hooks)
├─ 1 Discord announcement (community context)
├─ 1 Blog post outline (convert to written guide)
└─ 1 Email teaser (newsletter snippet)
```

**Time investment:** 2 hours to film/edit video + 30 min to extract social content = 7 pieces.

---

## PART 1: TWITTER/X TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Skill Spotlight Thread

**Goal:** Introduce a skill in depth. Drive traffic to YouTube video.

**Structure:** 5 tweets, ~400 words total, posted as thread

```
TWEET 1 (Hook + Problem):
I just built the [SKILL NAME] skill because [PROBLEM].

Most [audience type] waste hours on [pain point].

This skill [benefit in 1 sentence].

Here's what it does → [link to video]

[Emoji] [emoji] [emoji]

---

TWEET 2 (How It Works):
The skill works like this:

1. [Step 1 - simple explanation]
2. [Step 2 - simple explanation]
3. [Step 3 - simple explanation]

Total time: [X minutes] instead of [Y hours]

---

TWEET 3 (Real Example):
Here's a real example from building Some Claude Skills:

[Specific scenario where this saves time]

Result: [metric/outcome]

---

TWEET 4 (Insight/Philosophy):
Why this matters:

The best tools are [philosophy statement].
This skill embodies that because [reasoning].

It's not about hype, it's about [actual value].

---

TWEET 5 (CTA):
Try it yourself:

Install: someclaudeskills.com/skills/[skill-name]
Watch: [YouTube video link]
Join: discord.com/invite/[link]

What problem would YOU solve with this skill? Reply below.
```

**Best time to post:** Thursday 2-4 PM PT (tech audience active)
**Expected engagement:** 20-50 likes, 5-10 retweets, 3-5 replies

---

### Template 2: Opinion/Philosophy Thread

**Goal:** Share thinking, build authority. Evergreen content (perform well over time).

**Structure:** 4-6 tweets on Erich's perspective/learnings

```
TWEET 1 (Hot take):
[BOLD OPINION STATEMENT]

This is why most [tool/category] fail:
→ They chase novelty instead of curation
→ They optimize for noise, not signal
→ They count features, not impact

I think differently.

---

TWEET 2 (Reasoning):
After building 48 skills, I've learned:

Quality > Quantity
Curation > Novelty
Depth > Breadth

Every skill in this collection was designed to solve a REAL problem, not to sound impressive.

---

TWEET 3 (Evidence/Example):
Example: The design-system-creator skill.

Most "design" tools give you a thousand options.
This skill gives you ONE clear system.

Because startups don't need more choices, they need fewer decisions.

---

TWEET 4 (Personal story):
This philosophy comes from 12 years at Meta.

I saw products that:
- Had 50 features nobody used
- Were missing 1 feature that saved an hour/day

The lesson: ruthless prioritization beats feature-creep every time.

---

TWEET 5 (Call to arms):
So here's my invitation:

Skip the hype. Use skills built by someone who actually builds.

These aren't marketing fluff. They're made by a practitioner.

someclaudeskills.com/skills

---

TWEET 6 (Engagement CTA):

I'm genuinely curious what resonates with people who care about quality.

How the Career-Biographer Skill Turns Your Resume into Your Competitive Advantage

I've reviewed hundreds of resumes in my career at Meta, and I noticed a pattern: most resume formats hide your actual value.

The real issue is simple: resumes are documents, not narratives. They list jobs. They don't tell stories.

So I built the Career-Biographer skill to solve this.

It's designed to:
• Extract your authentic career narrative (what actually happened, not corporate-speak)
• Frame your experience as strategic progression (not just job hopping)
• Position you for the role you WANT, not just list what you've done

Result: Members testing it have moved from "resume-as-formality" to "resume-as-strategy." Interviews are more aligned. Offers are stronger.

If you're in career transition or job search, try it:

**Best time to post:** Tuesday-Thursday 8-10 AM PT (LinkedIn is most active mid-morning)

I just wrote a detailed guide: "[ARTICLE TITLE]"

Key takeaways:
• [Insight 1 - from article]

• [Insight 3 - from article]

This matters because [professional context].

Read the full guide: [Link]

What's YOUR experience with [article topic]? I'd love to hear how you approach this differently.
```

**Example:**

```
LINKEDIN POST

I wrote a comprehensive guide: "How to Build Claude Code Skills: The Complete Tutorial"

Most "build tools" guides assume you already know how to think about tool architecture. This guide assumes you don't—and walks you through the decision framework.

Key insights:
• Skills aren't just prompts—they're modular expertise systems
• The best skills solve ONE problem deeply, not 10 problems shallowly
• Your first skill should be something YOU actually use (eat your own dogfood)

This matters because the Claude Code ecosystem is early. You can shape it by building better skills.

Read the full guide: someclaudeskills.com/docs/...

Are you thinking about building a skill? What problem would you solve?
```

1. **Hook (0-3 sec)** - Catchy statement or visual
2. **Demo (4-15 sec)** - Show the skill in action
3. **Result (16-25 sec)** - Show the outcome
4. **CTA (26-30 sec)** - Where to get it

**Extraction Tips:**

[0-3 sec] TEXT ON SCREEN: "You spend hours on [task]"
[4-15 sec] DEMO: Show person struggling / show old workflow
[16-25 sec] TEXT: "What if it took 5 minutes?"
[26-30 sec] TEXT: "Try [Skill Name] | Link in bio"
```

```
[0-3 sec] TEXT: "[Skill Name]"
[4-15 sec] DEMO: Running skill (screen recording)

[26-30 sec] TEXT: "Skill saved me [time/effort]. Try it →"
```

### Posting Strategy for Shorts

**YouTube Shorts:**
- Post 1-2 new shorts per day (they're algorithm-friendly)
- Organize in "Skill Spotlight" playlist
- Each short drives traffic to full YouTube video

**TikTok:**
- Cross-post YouTube Shorts directly (TikTok integrates with YouTube)
- Add TikTok-specific captions/hashtags
- Use TikTok trends (sounds, transitions) when possible

**Hashtag Strategy:**
```
Tech/Developer Focused:
#ClaudeCode #AITools #DeveloperTools #Productivity #CodeSkills

Broad Discovery:
#AI #Tutorial #HowTo #Productivity #Tech

Niche-Specific (for different skills):
- ADHD content: #ADHD #ADHDTok #Executive Function
- Design: #WebDesign #UI/UX #Design
- Indie Hacking: #IndieDev #SoloPreneur #Startups
```

**Expected performance:**
- YouTube Shorts: 50-300 views per short (algorithm is generous)
- TikTok: 100-500 views per short (audience more engaged with short-form)

```

**Example:**

```
Hi [First Name],

This week I shipped: Career-Biographer Skill

Here's why it matters: Your resume is a document. It should be a narrative. This skill transforms your job history into a strategic story that gets interviews.

Real example: A community member went from 5 interview callbacks/month to 12 callbacks/month after using this to reframe her resume around "impact" instead of "duties."

---

WHAT ELSE HAPPENED:
- New tutorial: "Turning Your Resume Into Your Competitive Advantage" (blog post)
- Community highlight: See how Alex used this skill in production

---

NEXT WEEK:
I'm releasing the Code-Necromancer skill—for developers who need to modernize legacy codebases.

What would be most valuable to you? Reply to this email and let me know.

Erich

P.S. Building 48 skills taught me: curation beats novelty every time. Quality over hype. Depth over breadth. That's what we're building here.

## PART 8: QUICK REFERENCE - MONTHLY CHECKLIST

**Every month:**
- [ ] Review analytics (YouTube, Google Analytics, email opens)
- [ ] Identify 3 top-performing pieces of content
- [ ] Double down on what works (more tutorials on winning skills)
- [ ] Update underperforming blog posts
- [ ] Thank 3 active Discord members (DM or feature)
- [ ] Identify 1 community member for guest content/feature
- [ ] Plan Q2+ content based on data
- [ ] Send "monthly metrics" email to subscribers (transparency builds trust)

---

## Notes & Philosophy

**Why consistency matters:**
- Algorithms favor regular posting (YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- Audiences expect predictable cadence (news feed habits)
- Batching prevents burnout (do it once, post all week)
- Quality > Quantity (but consistency beats sporadic perfection)

**Why the Win31 aesthetic matters:**
- Every post should be visually distinctive
- Use consistent branding (colors, fonts, graphics)
- This builds recognition (people remember you)
- It's your unfair advantage in a crowded space

**Why community-first approach works:**
- People follow people, not brands
- Discord > social media for retention (owned audience)
- User-generated content is your best marketing
- Celebrating wins builds loyalty and word-of-mouth
