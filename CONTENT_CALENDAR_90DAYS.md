- Use templates (see CONTENT_STRATEGY.md appendix)
- **3-4 hours = 2-3 blog posts written**

**Editing Days:**
- Tuesday/Wednesday: edit all videos from week
- Use templates for title cards, intro graphics
- **2-3 hours = 2-3 videos edited + published**

**Social Content:**
- Thursday: write all week's Twitter threads + LinkedIn posts
- Friday: schedule on Hootsuite/Buffer/Later
- **1-2 hours = 15+ social posts scheduled**

**This batching = 8-10 hours of focused work = 200+ pieces of content/month**
