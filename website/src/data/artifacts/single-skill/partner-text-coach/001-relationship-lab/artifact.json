    "They'd been together for seven years and loved each other deeply—but their fights were getting worse. The pattern was always the same: she'd sense distance and reach out more intensely; he'd feel overwhelmed and withdraw further; she'd interpret the withdrawal as rejection and escalate; he'd shut down completely. Rinse, repeat, resentment.",
    "The partner-text-coach skill diagnosed the pattern immediately: classic anxious-avoidant attachment trap. Not a character flaw in either partner—a dance they'd learned in childhood, now playing out in their relationship. The question wasn't 'who's wrong?' but 'how do we change the choreography?'",
    "For thirty days, they practiced. Daily scenarios—some low-stakes ('planning a weekend'), some high-stakes ('feeling neglected')—where they'd write responses, get feedback, and try alternatives. The skill didn't just say 'that's wrong.' It explained WHY: 'That phrase triggers his withdrawal reflex because it implies obligation. Try this instead.'",
    "Week two was the breakthrough. They started recognizing their patterns IN THE MOMENT. She'd catch herself spiraling and say 'I'm doing the thing.' He'd notice his shutdown reflex and say 'I need space but I'm not leaving.' The patterns didn't disappear—they became visible, nameable, manageable.",
    "By day thirty, their communication score had jumped from 42 to 78. More importantly: in the month after, they counted twelve potential escalations that just... didn't happen. Fights that would have lasted days resolved in hours. The anxious-avoidant dance continued, but now they knew the steps—and how to change them."
