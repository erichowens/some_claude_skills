## What Changed

See the transcript and after/ directory to understand the complete transformation through 5 iterations:

1. **Iteration 1:** Foundation (anti-patterns, timeline, checklist)
2. **Iteration 2:** Actionability (workflows, tool explanations)
3. **Iteration 3:** Expert Knowledge (shibboleths, expanded principles)
4. **Iteration 4:** Usability (quick wins, simplified structure)
5. **Iteration 5:** Decision Support (decision trees, prioritization)

## Result

**482 lines → 470 lines** while adding substantially more value through focused, concise content.
