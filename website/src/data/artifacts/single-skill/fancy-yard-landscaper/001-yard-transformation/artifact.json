    "The backyard was technically large—a quarter acre—but it felt like a fishbowl. The neighbor's elevated deck looked directly down onto the patio. The street was visible through the side yard. The back neighbor's second-story windows had a clear view of everything. The homeowners had stopped using their outdoor space entirely.",
    "The first instinct was arborvitae. Everyone plants arborvitae, right? The fancy-yard-landscaper skill intervened immediately: 'Arborvitae are the number one regret in residential landscaping. They're slow, they're deer candy, bagworms love them, and when one dies in a row, you have an obvious gap for years.' The skill had seen too many 'arborvitae graveyards.'",
    "Instead: Nellie Stevens holly for the back corners (20 feet tall, evergreen, grows 3 feet per year, deer-resistant). Skip laurel for mid-height screening (dense enough to block the neighbor's deck by month 8). Winterberry hollies for winter interest when deciduous plants are bare. A layered approach that created depth, not just a green wall.",
    "The design went beyond privacy. A flagstone patio emerged under the existing oak tree—the tree they'd almost removed, now the crown jewel of the space. A pollinator garden in the sunny corner. A fire pit area positioned so that every seat had privacy from every sight line. The yard became a series of outdoor rooms instead of one exposed lawn.",
    "Eighteen months later: full privacy. Not the five-to-seven years arborvitae would have taken (if they survived). One hundred percent plant survival because every species was matched to the actual site conditions. Forty-plus fire pit nights that first full summer. Fourteen documented butterfly species in the pollinator garden. The fishbowl became a sanctuary."
