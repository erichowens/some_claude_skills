## What's Tested

### Unit Tests (61 total, &lt;300ms)
**Optimizer (21 tests)**
- Pattern matching: add_structure, add_chain_of_thought, add_constraints, add_output_format
- Convergence detection with score arrays
- Suggestion generation
- LLM scoring with mocked responses
- Candidate generation via OPRO meta-prompting
- Learning from similar prompts (RAG)
- Full optimization flow

**Embeddings (17 tests)**
- In-memory caching
- Redis caching (when available)
- Contextual embedding generation
- Batch processing
- Cosine similarity calculation
- Token counting

**VectorDB (23 tests)**
- Collection initialization with indexes
- Search with filters (minPerformance, domain)
- Upsert and retrieval
- Metric updates
- Stats collection
- Pagination via scroll
- Error recovery for all operations

### Integration Tests (17 total, ~51s with real APIs)
- Qdrant connectivity and collection verification
- Redis connectivity
- Real OpenAI embedding generation
- Embedding caching in Redis
- Vector upsert and retrieval
- Semantic similarity search
- Performance filtering
- Metric updates
- Real LLM-based prompt scoring
- Score differentiation (vague vs specific prompts)
- Full optimization of vague prompts
- Learning from similar high-performing prompts
- End-to-end workflow test

## Bugs Found & Fixed

### 1. Error Handling Placement
**Before:** Try block started after API call
```typescript
const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({...});
try {
  // parsing...
}
```

**After:** API call inside try block
```typescript
try {
  const response = await this.openai.chat.completions.create({...});
  // parsing...
}
```

### 2. Qdrant ID Format
**Before:** `const id = \`test-${uuidv4()}\``
**After:** `const id = uuidv4()` (pure UUID required)

### 3. Pattern Cascade Understanding
Test needed prompt that triggers specific patterns without triggering others (document the interaction)

## Deployment Ready
- Tests run in CI/CD
- Mocked unit tests are fast and free (no API calls)
- Integration tests prove real functionality
- Error handling verified
- Edge cases covered
