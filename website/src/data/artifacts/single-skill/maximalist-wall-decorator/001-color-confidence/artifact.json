      "duration": "Week 2-3",

      "outcome": "Learned the maximalist color distribution: 40% dominant (the green), 25% secondary (existing cream sofa), 20% accent (brass and gold), 15% pop (coral throw pillows). Suddenly the room 'made sense.'"

    "Every room was beige. Or gray. Or 'greige.' The homeowner had Pinterest boards full of colorful rooms they loved—jewel tones, bold patterns, maximalist abundance—but when it came to their own home, fear won. What if the colors clashed? What if they got tired of it? What if guests judged? So: beige. Safe, forgettable, beige.",
    "The maximalist-wall-decorator skill diagnosed the problem immediately: color terror, a form of decision paralysis caused by too many options and fear of 'permanent' mistakes. The cure wasn't a whole-house makeover. It was one wall. One foolproof combination. One small act of bravery.",
    "Hunter Green. Benjamin Moore 2041-10. Deep, rich, dramatic. The homeowner painted the living room accent wall on a Saturday and spent the next 48 hours in what the skill calls 'the panic window.' It's too dark. It's too much. I've made a terrible mistake. This is completely normal. By Monday, they loved it. By Wednesday, they were planning the next room.",
    "The skill introduced the 40-25-20-15 rule: 40% dominant color (the green wall), 25% secondary (their existing cream sofa—see, you don't have to buy all new furniture), 20% accent (brass lamps, gold frames), 15% pop (coral throw pillows that make the green sing). Suddenly maximalism had structure. Bold had rules. It wasn't chaos—it was composition.",
    "Nine months later: five rooms transformed. Deep coral in the dining room. Moody navy in the bedroom. Sunny mustard in the office. A 19-piece gallery wall mixing vintage oils, modern prints, mirrors, and sculptural objects. Seven lamps, none matching, all perfect. Zero beige walls remaining. The homeowner's parting words: 'I can't believe I lived in beige for ten years. This feels like ME.'"
