    "Three thousand two hundred forty-seven photos. Four hours of video. Twelve different cameras. This is what a modern wedding produces—a beautiful, overwhelming chaos of memories scattered across phones, SD cards, and cloud accounts. The couple wanted to experience their wedding again, not just scroll through an endless photo dump.",
    "The wedding-immortalist skill turned that chaos into something magical. First: the venue itself was reconstructed in 3D using Gaussian Splatting. Video frames from three angles trained a model that lets you literally walk through the ceremony arch, past the cocktail tables, onto the dance floor. It's not a video—it's a place you can explore.",
    "Then: every face. The skill detected 8,943 faces across all media and clustered them into 127 unique guests. No more hunting for photos of Aunt Martha—click her name, see her five best shots from the whole wedding, automatically selected by aesthetic quality. The couple named 89 guests; the remaining 38 got polite 'Guest' tags (everyone has those plus-ones they barely know).",
    "The real magic is Theatre Mode. Twenty-three hotspots placed throughout the 3D venue. Stand at the ceremony arch, click, and watch the vows play from that exact angle. Walk to the dance floor, click, and the first dance begins. It's like being there again, but with the power to pause, rewind, and linger.",
    "The whole experience is themed to match the wedding itself—sage green backgrounds, gold accents, a handwritten font that echoes the invitations. The skill extracted the color palette and style directly from the photos. This isn't a generic photo viewer. It's THEIR wedding, preserved in a way that feels alive."
