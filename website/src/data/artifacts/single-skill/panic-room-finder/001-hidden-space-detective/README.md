# The Hidden Space Detective

## Finding 47 Unaccounted Square Feet in a 1924 Craftsman

This artifact demonstrates the complete investigation process for discovering hidden spaces in homes. Using the panic-room-finder skill, a homeowner's vague suspicion about their "too-shallow closet" transformed into the discovery of a Prohibition-era liquor storage room that had been sealed for 70 years.

## The Investigation

### Initial Suspicion
The master bedroom closet never felt right. Too shallow for the space it occupied, with a back wall that felt slightly cold. Rather than dismiss the feeling, the homeowner decided to investigate systematically.

### The Math That Revealed the Truth

```
EXTERIOR MEASUREMENT (back wall):     32 ft
─────────────────────────────────────────────
INTERIOR ROOMS:
├── Master Bedroom:                   14 ft
├── Wall Thickness:                    0.5 ft
├── Office:                           10 ft
├── Wall Thickness:                    0.5 ft
├── Hallway:                           3 ft
└── Wall Thickness:                    0.5 ft
─────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL INTERIOR:                       28.5 ft
─────────────────────────────────────────────
DISCREPANCY:                           3.5 ft
```

A 3.5-foot discrepancy is too large to be construction variance. This indicated a high probability of hidden space.

### Acoustic Testing Results

Using the systematic knock test grid:

```
     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10  (feet)
   ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
 8 │ S  │ S  │ S  │ S  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
 6 │ S  │ S  │ S  │ S  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
 4 │ S  │ S  │ S  │ S  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │
   ├────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┼────┤
 2 │ S  │ S  │ S  │ S  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │ V  │
   └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘

S = Solid (normal wall construction)
V = Void (distinctly hollow, drum-like resonance)
```

The clear boundary at the 4-foot mark confirmed a substantial void behind the visible wall.

### The Discovery

The access point wasn't in the wall—it was in the floor. A trapdoor hidden under the closet carpet, with original 1920s hardware still functional. The ladder descended into a 6x8 foot underground room with:

- Wooden shelving with bottle-sized slots (classic Prohibition feature)
- Ventilation pipe to exterior (for air circulation)
- 1929 newspaper fragments
- Structurally sound concrete walls

## Historical Context

Built in 1924, this home falls squarely in the Prohibition era (1920-1933). Common hidden features from this period include:

- Underground storage rooms (like this one)
- False walls behind closets
- Basement compartments with concealed access
- Trap doors under furniture

The homeowner's grandfather owned the house during Prohibition and likely sealed the room after repeal in 1933.

## Outcome

The hidden room was structurally sound and has been converted into a wine cellar—an appropriate tribute to its original purpose. The discovery added both historical interest and practical value to the home.

## Key Learnings

1. **Trust your instincts, but verify with data** - The "feeling" about the closet was validated by measurement
2. **Exterior vs interior is the most reliable method** - Simple math revealed the discrepancy
3. **Access points aren't always obvious** - Floor access is common in Prohibition-era features
4. **Historical research predicts feature types** - Knowing the era helps interpret findings
5. **Original hardware often survives** - 70-year-old hinges still worked

## Skills Used

- **panic-room-finder**: Provided measurement templates, acoustic testing protocols, historical pattern matching, and systematic investigation methodology
