    "It started with a feeling. The master bedroom closet in this 1924 Craftsman never felt right—too shallow for the footprint, the back wall slightly cold to the touch. Most homeowners would shrug and move on. This one decided to investigate.",
    "The panic-room-finder skill turned intuition into method. First: the numbers. Exterior measurement of the back wall: 32 feet. Sum of interior rooms along that wall: 27 feet. Add 2 feet for wall thickness. That leaves 3 feet unaccounted for—and 3 feet is too much to be construction variance.",
    "The acoustic test sealed it. Using a systematic grid pattern, knocking every foot along the closet's back wall revealed the truth: solid for the first four feet (drywall over studs over drywall), then dramatically hollow for the remaining six. Not stud-hollow. VOID-hollow. The kind of hollow that says 'there's a room back here.'",
    "The access point wasn't where you'd expect. No hidden panel in the wall, no bookshelf that swings open. Instead: a seam in the closet floor, invisible under the carpet. A trapdoor with 1920s hinges, leading down a wooden ladder into a 6x8 foot underground room. Wooden shelves with bottle-shaped slots. A ventilation pipe to the outside. Newspaper fragments from 1929. This was a Prohibition-era liquor storage room, sealed up when the homeowner's grandfather 'went legit' after repeal.",
    "The room sat empty for 70 years, waiting to be found. Now it's a wine cellar—a fitting tribute to its original purpose, brought back to life by someone who trusted their instincts and followed the math."
