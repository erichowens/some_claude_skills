# Before: The Initial Request

**User**: "Let's do some deep research and build a CV/resume creator who can work in tandem with the cartographer and biographer skills."

## Context

- **No implementation existed** - Just an idea
- **Broad scope** - "CV/resume creator" could mean many things
- **Integration requirement** - Must work with career-biographer and competitive-cartographer
- **Research needed** - ATS requirements, resume best practices, data schemas

## Initial State

```
cv-creator-implementation/
└── (empty directory)
```

**Files**: 0
**Lines of Code**: 0
**Documentation**: 0
**Working Examples**: 0
**ATS Score**: N/A

## The Challenge

Transform a verbal request into:
1. Production-ready TypeScript implementation
2. ATS-optimized PDF generation
3. Deploy-ready portfolio websites
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Working examples

## User's Expectations

- Research ATS requirements thoroughly
- Build something that actually works
- Integrate with existing skills (biographer, cartographer)
- Make it useful for real job seekers

## The Journey Begins

From this single sentence request to ~2,000 lines of production code in one focused sprint.
