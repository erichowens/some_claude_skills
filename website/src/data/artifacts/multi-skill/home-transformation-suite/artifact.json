  "narrative": [
    "This home started like millions of others: beige walls, builder-grade everything, a yard that was just 'mowed lawn with some bushes.' The neighbors could see straight into every window. Inside, nothing reflected who actually lived there. It was shelter, not sanctuary.",
    "The transformation started outside. The fancy-yard-landscaper skill analyzed the property like a military strategist: where are the sight lines? What grows fast? What survives deer and drought and Zone 6 winters? The result wasn't a row of arborvitae (the skill warned hard against that particular trap). Instead: skip laurel for year-round density, hollies for winter berries, a pollinator garden that buzzed with life by June.",
    "Inside, the maximalist-wall-decorator threw out the rulebook. 'Neutral walls make a room feel larger' gave way to 'neutral walls make a room feel boring.' Emerald green in the living room. Ruby red in the dining room. A gallery wall that mixes original art with mirrors, sculptural objects, and framed concert posters—23 pieces that tell a life story better than any single painting could.",
    "But the real surprise was underground. The panic-room-finder skill noticed something wrong with the basement measurements: 200 square feet that existed on the exterior footprint but not in any accessible room. Acoustic testing confirmed it—a void behind the workshop wall. Behind that wall: a sealed coal storage room from 1912, perfectly preserved, waiting to become something new.",
    "That hidden room is now a meditation space. Sound-dampened, warm-lit, walls covered in textiles collected from travels. It's the secret heart of the house—discovered through curiosity and math, transformed through intention and color. The home went from generic to deeply personal, from shelter to story, from house to home."
