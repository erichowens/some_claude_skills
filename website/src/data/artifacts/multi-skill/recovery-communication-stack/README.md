# Recovery Communication Stack

## Overview

This artifact demonstrates how three recovery-focused skills combine to address both individual sobriety and relationship repair:

1. **modern-drug-rehab-computer** - Knowledge foundation
2. **sober-addict-protector** - Daily protection practices
3. **partner-text-coach** - Communication repair

## The Challenge

Recovery from addiction doesn't happen in a vacuum. When someone gets sober:
- Relationships have been damaged by broken trust and promises
- Partners have their own trauma from the addiction
- Communication patterns established during use don't work in sobriety
- Both people need support, not just the person in recovery

## How the Skills Work Together

## Sample Scenario: Navigating a Difficult Text

**The situation**: Partner sends: "Fine. Do whatever you want."

### Analysis (partner-text-coach)

**Layer 1 - Surface**: Permission given
**Layer 2 - Emotion**: Frustration, feeling unheard, possibly hurt
**Layer 3 - Need**: Needs to feel considered, included in decisions, valued

### Suggested Response (applying NVC)

```
"I can hear that you're frustrated, and you're right—
I should have checked with you first before making plans.
I want you to know your input matters to me.
Can we talk about this when I get home?"
```

### Self-Check (sober-addict-protector)

Before responding:
- Am I HALT? (Check in with physical/emotional state)
- Is this a high-risk situation? (Conflict can trigger cravings)
- Do I need to use a coping skill first?

### Context (modern-drug-rehab-computer)

- Relationship stress is a top relapse trigger
- This is exactly why couples therapy matters
- Partner's frustration is valid and related to trust damaged during addiction

## The Bigger Picture

This stack acknowledges something often overlooked: **recovery is relational**.

The person getting sober isn't the only one healing. Partners carry their own wounds from the addiction—the lies, the broken promises, the fear. They may have developed hypervigilance, codependency patterns, or their own mental health challenges.

When both people get support—the person in recovery AND their partner—outcomes improve dramatically. That's why:

- The rehab computer explains Al-Anon/Nar-Anon for partners
- The protector strongly advocates for couples therapy
- The text coach provides tools for BOTH sides of the conversation
