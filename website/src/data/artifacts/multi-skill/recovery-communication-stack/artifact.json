  "narrative": [
    "Recovery doesn't happen in isolation. When someone gets sober, they're not just healing their relationship with substances—they're rebuilding every relationship that addiction touched. This artifact demonstrates how three skills work together to address the full picture.",
    "The modern-drug-rehab-computer provides the foundation: evidence-based understanding of treatment options, coping skills like TIPP and urge surfing, and the truth about MAT (it's medicine, not a crutch). Knowledge is power, especially when fighting misinformation.",
    "The sober-addict-protector takes that knowledge and makes it daily practice. The HALT+ check-in becomes ritual. High-risk situations get identified before they become crises. And critically, it doesn't shy away from the hard truth: if you're in a relationship, couples therapy isn't optional—it's where the real repair happens.",
    "Finally, the partner-text-coach addresses the communication that addiction broke. Using attachment theory, we understand why the anxious-pursuer/avoidant-withdrawer dynamic is so common in recovery relationships. With NVC-based templates and scripts for difficult conversations, both partners can start communicating with clarity instead of reactivity.",
    "The result isn't a cure—recovery doesn't work that way. It's a system. Daily practices that compound. Communication skills that improve with use. Knowledge that empowers instead of shames. And most importantly, the acknowledgment that rebuilding relationships takes as much intention as building sobriety."
