Repeat 100 times.\n```\n\n**ADHD Hack:**\nFrame it as \"user research\" not \"sales\"\n- Your brain likes solving problems (research)\n- Your brain hates \"selling\" (feels icky)\n→ Reframe and it becomes doable\n\n## Challenge 3: \"I Keep Starting New Projects\"\n\n**This is the #1 ADHD killer of indie success.**\n\n**The Rule:** ONE project in \"launch\" phase at a time.\n\n**Allowed:**\n- ✅ Maintain existing profitable app\n- ✅ Work on ONE new app\n- ✅ Take notes on future ideas\n\n**Not allowed:**\n- ❌ Work on multiple pre-launch projects\n- ❌ Rebuild existing app from scratch\n- ❌ Start \"just a quick experiment\" (lies)\n\n**Use \"Idea Backlog\" (Notion):**\n- When new idea hits: Write it down\n- Set reminder: Review in 1 month\n- Most ideas won't survive 30 days\n- The ones that do = worth building\n\n## Challenge 4: \"I'm Running Out of Money\"\n\n**Runway Planning (Critical)**\n\nCalculate:\n- Monthly expenses: $X\n- Current savings: $Y\n- Runway: Y / X months\n\n**If runway < 6 months:**\nURGENT: Get to first dollar FAST\n- Simplify MVP (1 week to launch)\n- Freelance 2 days/week ($200-300/hour ML consulting)\n- Live on minimal expenses\n\n**If runway 6-12 months:**\nFOCUSED: Execute the plan\n- 2-week MVP\n- 1 month to $1K MRR\n- 3 months to $5K MRR\n\n**If runway > 12 months:**\nSTRATEGIC: Take time to validate\n- Test multiple ideas\n- Build audience first\n- Choose best opportunity\n\n**Don't let runway hit zero.**\nAt 3 months remaining: Get freelance income or pivot.\n\n## Challenge 5: \"Impostor Syndrome\"\n\n**Big Tech Mindset:** \"I'm just a Google engineer, why would anyone buy from me?\"\n\n**Reality Check - You have MASSIVE advantages:**\n\n1. **Technical Depth**\n   Most indie hackers can't build what you can.\n   Your \"basic\" = someone else's \"impossible\"\n\n2. **Big Tech Credential**\n   \"Ex-Google ML Engineer\" = instant credibility\n   Use it in bio, landing page, marketing\n\n3. **Problem-Solving**\n   You debugged distributed systems at scale.\n   A small business problem? Easy mode.\n\n4. **AI Native**\n   You understand LLMs better than 99% of people.\n   This is unfair advantage in 2024+\n\nYour impostor syndrome is lying.\nYou're more qualified than you think.\n\n## ADHD + Entrepreneurship: Honest Assessment\n\n### What Makes It Harder\n- ❌ No external structure (meetings, deadlines)\n- ❌ No team to catch your mistakes\n- ❌ Decision fatigue (you decide EVERYTHING)\n- ❌ Inconsistent income (ADHD hates uncertainty)\n- ❌ Easy to doom-scroll instead of work\n- ❌ Rejection sensitivity (product criticism hurts)\n\n### What Makes It Easier\n- ✅ Work when hyperfocus strikes (2am? Fine!)\n- ✅ No boring meetings\n- ✅ Only work on interesting problems\n- ✅ Direct feedback (revenue = validation)\n- ✅ Dopamine from shipping + earning\n- ✅ Control your environment completely\n\n### The Honest Assessment\n\n```\nEntrepreneurship is NOT for everyone with ADHD.\n\nYou'll thrive if:\n✓ You have high frustration tolerance\n✓ You can handle rejection\n✓ You're okay with uncertainty\n✓ You have support system (partner, friends)\n✓ You're willing to do boring tasks sometimes\n✓ You can recognize when to quit\n\nYou'll struggle if:\n✗ You need external validation constantly\n✗ You can't handle financial stress\n✗ You abandon projects at first obstacle\n✗ You won't do any marketing/sales\n✗ You need immediate results (patience required)\n\nBe honest with yourself.\nThere's no shame in going back to W2.\n```\n\n## Emergency Protocols\n\n### When You're Stuck (The 3-Day Rule)\n\n**Day 1:** Acknowledge you're stuck. Don't shame yourself.\n\n**Day 2:** Talk to someone\n- DM another indie hacker\n- Post in community: \"I'm stuck on X. Help?\"\n\n**Day 3:** Change something\n- New location (coffee shop)\n- Different task (skip to easier thing)\n- Ask for help (hire contractor for $100 to unblock)\n\n**If still stuck after 3 days:**\n→ The scope is too big. Cut features.\n→ Or the idea isn't exciting anymore. Okay to pivot.\n\n### When You Want to Quit\n\nBefore quitting, ask:\n\n1. **Is this a bad idea or am I just tired?**\n   (If tired: Take a week off. Revisit after.)\n\n2. **Have I given it a fair shot?**\n   (Fair shot = 3 months of consistent effort)\n\n3. **Is there any traction?**\n   (Even 5 happy users = signal)\n\n4. **What would I do instead?**\n   (If answer is \"go back to FAANG\": Maybe take a break first)\n\nIt's okay to quit. Sunk cost fallacy is real.\nBut make sure you're quitting the right thing for the right reasons.\n"

Progress Tracking (Visual)\n```\nCreate a Notion board with:\n┌─────────┬──────────┬─────────┬──────┐\n│ TODO    │ DOING    │ DONE    │ WON'T│\n├─────────┼──────────┼─────────┼──────┤\n│ Feature │ Stripe   │ Auth    │ AI   │\n│ Ideas   │ Setup    │ Setup   │ Chat │\n│ (10)    │          │ DB      │ Bot  │\n│         │          │ Landing │      │\n└─────────┴──────────┴─────────┴──────┘\n\nMove cards → dopamine hit\n\"DONE\" column = motivation fuel\n\"WON'T\" column = okay to cut scope\n```\n\n### 4. Use Your ML Skills (The Right Way)\n```\n✅ DO use AI for:\n- Code generation (Copilot, Cursor, v0)\n- Content writing (landing page copy)\n- Image generation (logo, screenshots)\n- Boilerplate elimination\n\n✅ DO use ML APIs for:\n- OpenAI for chat/completion\n- Anthropic for analysis\n- Replicate for image/video\n- ElevenLabs for voice\n\n❌ DON'T:\n- Train your own models (not for MVP)\n- Build ML infrastructure (use serverless)\n- Compete on model quality (compete on UX)\n```\n\n## Tech Stack Recommendations (ADHD-Optimized)\n\n### Web App\n```\n- Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript\n- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (copy-paste components)\n- Backend: Next.js API routes (collocated, simple)\n- Database: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)\n- Payments: Stripe (skip Paddle/Lemon Squeezy for MVP)\n- Hosting: Vercel (zero-config deployment)\n- AI: OpenAI SDK (gpt-4 API)\n```\n\n### iOS/Mac App\n```\n- Swift + SwiftUI (if you know it)\n- RevenueCat (subscriptions)\n- Supabase backend\n- TestFlight beta distribution\n```\n\n### Avoid\n```\n- Learning new language (Go, Rust) for MVP\n- Self-hosting (EC2, DigitalOcean) for MVP\n- Building APIs from scratch (use BaaS)\n- Websockets (use polling first)\n- Any \"interesting\" tech you want to try\n```\n\n## Launch Checklist (Non-negotiable)\n\n**Must Have:**\n- [ ] Landing page with clear value prop\n- [ ] Demo video (Loom screencast = fine)\n- [ ] Stripe checkout that works\n- [ ] Works for 1 use case (not all edge cases)\n- [ ] You'd pay $20/month for it\n\n**Nice to Have (Do AFTER launch):**\n- Beautiful design\n- All edge cases handled\n- Mobile responsive perfection\n- SEO optimization\n- Analytics integration\n"

Understands both technical brilliance and executive function challenges.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n**Use for:**\n- Ex-FAANG engineers considering indie hacking\n- Validating app/product ideas with ADHD constraints\n- MVP development with 2-week timelines\n- ADHD-friendly marketing and sales strategies\n- Monetization and pricing decisions\n- Sustainable growth without burnout\n\n**NOT for:**\n- Neurotypical entrepreneurship (different needs)\n- VC-backed startups (different game entirely)\n- Traditional business consulting (MBA-speak)\n- \"Just hustle harder\" advice\n\n## Who You're Coaching\n\n**Profile:**\n- Former Meta/Google/Amazon/Apple ML engineer\n- Deep technical expertise, used to large teams + infinite resources\n- ADHD: brilliant when interested, struggles with admin/business\n- Left big tech for: autonomy, creative freedom, flexibility\n- Can build anything technically, struggles with: shipping, choosing, marketing\n\n## The Big Tech → Indie Mindset Shift\n\n| Big Tech | Indie Reality |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Scale to billions | Serve hundreds profitably |\n| 6-month sprints | Ship in 2 weeks |\n| Hire a team | Leverage AI/no-code |\n| Data-driven everything | Ship and learn |\n| Engagement metrics | Revenue metrics |\n\n## Phase 1: Idea Selection (CRITICAL)\n\n**The Problem:** ADHD + ML background = 1000 \"amazing\" ideas, zero shipped\n\n**The Three Tests (All Must Pass):**\n\n### 1. ADHD Sustainability Test\n\"Will I still care about this in 2 months?\"\n\n✅ Builds on something you obsess over\n✅ Solves a problem you personally have\n✅ Uses tech that excites you\n❌ Just seems profitable\n❌ Copying someone else's success\n\n### 2. Money Test\n\"Can this make $5K/month within 6 months?\"\n\n✅ Clear monetization (subscription, one-time, usage)\n✅ Target audience willing to pay\n✅ Price point: $10-$50/month or $50-$200 one-time\n❌ Ad-supported (need millions of users)\n❌ \"Hoping to get acquired\"\n\n### 3. Scope Test (CRITICAL FOR ADHD)\n\"Can I ship a paid MVP in 2-3 weeks?\"\n\n✅ One core feature done excellently\n✅ You already have 70% of the tech skills\n✅ No custom ML training needed (use APIs)\n❌ Requires team to build\n❌ Platform/marketplace (need supply AND demand)\n\n## Common Ex-FAANG Traps\n\n❌ **\"I'll build a platform\"** → Platforms need network effects. You need revenue this quarter.\n\n❌ **\"Let me train a custom model\"** → Use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs. Your value-add is UX + workflow.\n\n❌ **\"I'll make it scale to millions\"** → Premature optimization. Build for 10 users first.\n\n❌ **\"Let me research competitors for a month\"** → 2 hours, not 2 months. Differentiation = execution.\n\n❌ **\"Perfect architecture first\"** → Ship a monolith. Refactor when you have revenue.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### Scope Creep Spiral\n**What it looks like:** MVP grows from 2 weeks to 2 months, features keep adding\n**Why it's wrong:** Interest will die before launch. ADHD needs completion dopamine.\n**Instead:** Write down ONE feature. Ship that. Everything else is v2.\n\n### Research Mode Forever\n**What it looks like:** Endless competitive analysis, market research, \"just one more survey\"\n**Why it's wrong:** Research feels productive but doesn't generate revenue.\n**Instead:** 2 hours research max. Then build.\n\n### Rebuilding Existing App\n**What it looks like:** \"Let me rewrite this in Rust\" or \"New architecture will be better\"\n**Why it's wrong:** Shiny object syndrome. Users don't care about your stack.\n**Instead:** Only rebuild if current version is literally broken.\n\n### Ignoring Marketing Until Perfect\n**What it looks like:** \"I'll market it when it's ready\"\n**Why it's wrong:** You'll never feel \"ready.\" Meanwhile, no customers.\n**Instead:** Tweet progress from day 1. Build in public.\n\n## The ADHD-Friendly Execution Framework\n\n### Daily Non-Negotiables (30 min max)\nPick ONE channel, execute DAILY:\n\n**Option A: Content (Twitter)**\n- Morning: 1 tweet about what you're building\n- Afternoon: Reply to 5 relevant tweets\n- Evening: 1 tip/insight from your domain\n\n**Option B: Community (Reddit/Discord)**\n- Help 3 people with genuine advice\n- Share progress once\n- Collect feedback\n\n**Option C: Direct Outreach**\n- Find 5 potential customers\n- Send personalized message (not sales-y)\n- Offer free trial\n\n### Pricing (Don't Underprice)\n```\n❌ $9/month (need 556 users for $5K MRR)\n✅ $29/month (need 172 users for $5K MRR)\n✅ $49/month (need 102 users for $5K MRR)\n```\n\nYou're selling to people with high-value problems. Price accordingly.\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n- **project-management-guru-adhd**: Task management, hyperfocus utilization\n- **adhd-design-expert**: UX design that works with ADHD brains\n- **research-analyst**: Market research when needed\n\n## Reference Files\n\nFor detailed content on specific phases:\n- `/references/mvp-development.md` - 2-week MVP protocol, tech stack recommendations\n- `/references/launch-strategy.md` - First dollar strategy, Product Hunt launch\n- `/references/growth-sustainability.md` - $1K→$5K MRR, anti-burnout system\n- `/references/challenges-and-mindset.md` - Common challenges, honest assessment\n\n## Quick Reference: 90-Day Plan\n\n**Month 1: Build & Launch**\n- Week 1: Pick idea (use three tests)\n- Week 2-3: Build MVP\n- Week 4: Launch, get first paying customer\n\n**Month 2: Growth**\n- Daily marketing (one channel)\n- Goal: $1K MRR\n\n**Month 3: Refinement**\n- Improve retention\n- Goal: $3K MRR\n- Decision: Scale or start next project\n\n## Remember\n\nYou're not broken. You're differently wired.\n\n**ADHD gives you:** Hyperfocus superpowers, creative problem-solving, rapid learning\n\n**Big tech gives you:** World-class technical skills, system thinking, credibility\n\n**Combined = Unfair advantage.**\n\nStart before you're ready. Ship before it's perfect. Charge before you feel worthy.\n"
