SaaS products? Consulting services? |\n| **User's offer** | What are they selling/showcasing? |\n| **User's background** | Strengths, constraints, unique assets |\n| **Goals** | Brand awareness? Lead generation? Thought leadership? |\n\n## Step 2: Identify Players\n\nFind three types of competitors:\n\n### Direct Competitors\nSame domain, same audience, same offering\n- Portfolio: Other senior engineers in same tech stack\n- SaaS: Other project management tools for design teams\n- Service: Other freelance designers in same city\n\n### Adjacent Competitors\nNearby domains, overlapping audience\n- Portfolio: Engineers in adjacent stacks, designers with similar aesthetic\n- SaaS: Adjacent tools (time tracking, team chat) that solve related problems\n- Service: Agencies or in-house teams user competes against for work\n\n### Aspirational References\nDifferent domain but desired positioning/vibe\n- Portfolio: Apple's minimal aesthetic (though not a portfolio)\n- SaaS: Notion's community-driven growth (though different product)\n- Service: Patagonia's values-driven brand (though different industry)\n\n## Step 3: Analyze Positioning\n\nFor each competitor, extract:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompetitorProfile {\n  name: string;\n  url: string;\n\n  positioning: {\n    tagline: string;         // How they describe themselves\n    primaryMessage: string;  // Main value prop\n    differentiation: string; // How they claim to be different\n  };\n\n  visualStrategy: {\n    aestheticStyle: string;  // Minimal, maximal, corporate, edgy\n    colorPalette: string[];\n    typography: string;\n    layout: string;\n  };\n\n  contentStrategy: {\n    tone: string;   // Professional, casual, technical, friendly\n    depth: string;  // Surface-level or deep technical content\n    focus: string;  // Process, results, personality, credentials\n  };\n\n  strengths: string[];\n  weaknesses: string[];\n  audience: string;\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Create Competitive Map\n\nPlot competitors on 2D space using strategic dimensions.\n\n### Common Dimension Pairs\n\n| Pair | Best For |\n|------|----------|\n| Technical depth ↔ Accessibility | Portfolios |\n| Feature-rich ↔ Simple | Products |\n| Enterprise ↔ Individual | Tools |\n| Conservative ↔ Innovative | Agencies |\n| Low-touch ↔ High-touch | Services |\n\n### Map Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompetitiveMap {\n  axes: {\n    x: { name: string; low: string; high: string };\n    y: { name: string; low: string; high: string };\n  };\n\n  players: Array<{\n    name: string;\n    position: { x: number; y: number }; // 0-100 scale\n    size?: number; // Optional: market presence\n  }>;\n\n  clusters: Array<{\n    name: string;\n    members: string[];\n    characteristics: string;\n  }>;\n\n  whiteSpace: Array<{\n    position: { x: number; y: number };\n    description: string;\n    why: string;\n  }>;\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Identify White Space\n\n### Criteria for Good White Space\n\n| Criterion | Question |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Viable** | Does target audience exist and is reachable? |\n| **Defensible** | Does user have unique advantage to claim this space? |\n| **Sustainable** | Is it a lasting gap, not temporary? |\n| **Aligned** | Does it match user's strengths and goals? |\n\n### Types of White Space\n\n**Intersection Spaces**\n- \"Technical depth + warm personality\" (most engineers pick one)\n- \"Enterprise features + indie pricing\"\n- \"Conservative trust + innovative approach\"\n\n**Under-served Audiences**\n- \"Mid-market companies\" (everyone targets enterprise or startups)\n- \"Non-technical founders\"\n- \"Legacy system maintainers\"\n\n**Contrarian Positions**\n- \"Slow and thoughtful\" (when everyone races to launch fast)\n- \"Expensive and exclusive\" (when market races to bottom)\n- \"Opinionated and prescriptive\" (when everyone offers flexibility)\n\n## Step 6: Strategic Recommendations\n\n```typescript\ninterface Strategy {\n  positioning: {\n    headline: string;       // One-line positioning statement\n    differentiators: string[];\n    messaging: string;\n  };\n\n  visualStrategy: {\n    aestheticDirection: string;\n    avoid: string[];   // Crowded visual patterns\n    embrace: string[]; // Underutilized patterns\n  };\n\n  contentStrategy: {\n    topics: string[];\n    tone: string;\n    depth: string;\n  };\n\n  risks: string[];\n  validation: string[];\n}\n```\n\n## Validation Questions\n\nBefore finalizing, check:\n1. **Credible?** Can user actually deliver on this positioning?\n2. **Memorable?** Will people remember how user is different?\n3. **Defensible?** Can user protect this from copycats?\n4. **Sustainable?** Will this work long-term?\n5. **Authentic?** Does it match user's genuine strengths?\n"

Zoom out to adjacent categories\n2. Zoom in to micro-niches\n3. Try different axis pairs for mapping\n4. Consider positioning on intangibles (values, personality, process)\n\n---\n\n## Issue: User Resists Differentiation\n\n**Example**: \"But I can do everything they do!\"\n\n**Fix**: Explain positioning vs capability.\n\n> You can DO many things, but you're KNOWN for one thing. Choose what you want to be known for.\n\nThe goal isn't to limit what you offer - it's to create a memorable first impression that gets you in the door.\n\n---\n\n## Issue: White Space Has No Audience\n\n**Example**: Found gap but no one wants that position\n\n**Fix**: Validate before committing.\n\nWhite space can be empty because:\n- It's genuinely overlooked (opportunity!)\n- It's bad space no one wants (trap!)\n\n**Validation methods**:\n- Search for content/discussions in that space\n- Look for failed attempts to occupy that space\n- Ask potential audience if they'd value that positioning\n\n---\n\n## Issue: Recommended Positioning Feels Inauthentic\n\n**Example**: Strategy is sound but doesn't match user's personality\n\n**Fix**: Positioning must be authentic.\n\nDon't force a positioning that doesn't fit who you actually are. Instead:\n1. Start with user's genuine strengths and values\n2. Find white space that aligns with those\n3. If no alignment exists, look at different competitive dimensions\n\n---\n\n## Issue: Too Many Competitors to Map\n\n**Example**: 50+ players in the space\n\n**Fix**: Tier and filter.\n\n1. **Primary** (5-8): Direct competitors user most often loses to\n2. **Secondary** (10-15): Adjacent players worth watching\n3. **Aspirational** (3-5): Reference points for positioning\n\nMap primary tier in detail; note secondary and aspirational for context.\n\n---\n\n## Issue: Competitors Keep Shifting Position\n\n**Example**: Market moving too fast to map\n\n**Fix**: Map trends, not just current state.\n\n- Where are competitors moving TO?\n- What positions are being abandoned?\n- What new entrants are claiming?\n\nThe valuable white space is often where the market is heading, not where it currently is.\n\n---\n\n## Issue: User's Positioning Gets Copied\n\n**Example**: Differentiation works but competitors follow\n\n**Fix**: Build defensible positioning.\n\nDefensibility sources:\n- **Expertise**: Deep specialization that takes years to build\n- **Community**: Network effects around your position\n- **Track record**: Portfolio of proof that compounds\n- **Personality**: Your unique voice can't be copied\n\nIf positioning is purely visual or message-based, it will be copied. Build substance behind it.\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices Checklist\n\n### Start with User, Not Market\n1. What's genuinely unique about user?\n2. What do they do better than anyone?\n3. What do they want to be known for?\n4. Then find where that fits in competitive landscape\n\n### Be Ruthlessly Honest\n- Point out when user's desired positioning is crowded\n- Identify genuine weaknesses vs competitors\n- Recommend against poor strategic fit\n- Better to surface hard truths early\n\n### Provide Evidence\nDon't just say \"this space is crowded\" - show specific examples:\n- \"Here are 15 portfolios using exact same layout\"\n- \"Here are 8 products with nearly identical taglines\"\n- \"Here's how competitors cluster around this position\"\n\n### Think Long-Term\n- Will this positioning still work in 2-3 years?\n- Is it defensible or easily copied?\n- Does it allow room to grow/evolve?\n"

Use when users need competitive analysis, market positioning strategy, differentiation tactics, or \"how do I stand out?\" guidance across any domain (portfolios, products, services). NOT for market size estimation or financial forecasting.\nallowed-tools: Read,Write,WebSearch,WebFetch\n---\n\n# Competitive Cartographer\n\nA strategic analyst who maps competitive spaces to reveal positioning opportunities, white space, and differentiation strategies. Creates \"you are here\" maps in crowded markets.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\nUser: \"How do I stand out as a senior frontend engineer?\"\n\nCartographer:\n1. Define space: \"Professional portfolios for senior frontend engineers\"\n2. Identify players:\n   - Direct: Other senior frontend engineers in similar tech stacks\n   - Adjacent: Full-stack engineers, design engineers\n   - Aspirational: Apple's minimal aesthetic\n3. Map on axes: Technical Depth (x) vs Design Polish (y)\n4. Find white space: High tech + high design (rare combination)\n5. Recommend positioning: \"Engineer who thinks like a designer\"\n```\n\n**Key principle**: Don't just list competitors - map them spatially to reveal positioning opportunities.\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use when:**\n- User asks \"how do I stand out?\" or \"what makes me different?\"\n- Launching product/service and need positioning strategy\n- Feeling lost in crowded market\n- Considering pivot or repositioning\n\n**Do NOT use when:**\n- User needs market size or TAM estimates\n- Financial projections or fundraising strategy\n- Specific feature-by-feature comparison\n- User already has clear positioning\n\n## The 6-Step Process\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1. Define Space | Domain, user's offer, background, goals |\n| 2. Identify Players | Direct, adjacent, aspirational competitors |\n| 3. Analyze Positioning | Extract taglines, visual strategy, content strategy |\n| 4. Create Map | Plot on 2D axes, identify clusters |\n| 5. Find White Space | Viable, defensible, sustainable, aligned gaps |\n| 6.

What's genuinely unique about user?\n2. What do they do better than anyone?\n3. What do they want to be known for?\n4. Then find where that fits in competitive landscape\n\n**Be Ruthlessly Honest**\n- Point out crowded positioning\n- Identify genuine weaknesses\n- Recommend against poor strategic fit\n\n**Provide Evidence**\n- \"Here are 15 portfolios using exact same layout\"\n- \"Here are 8 products with nearly identical taglines\"\n- \"Here's how competitors cluster around this position\"\n\n## Reference Files\n\n| File | Contents |\n|------|----------|\n| `references/mapping-process.md` | Detailed 6-step methodology, TypeScript interfaces, axis pairs |\n| `references/domain-positioning.md` | Portfolio, SaaS, consulting-specific positioning + examples |\n| `references/troubleshooting.md` | Common issues, validation methods, best practices checklist |\n\n## Integration with Other Skills\n\n| Skill | Integration |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **design-archivist** | Visual pattern database informs differentiation strategy |\n| **vibe-matcher** | Translate positioning into emotional/visual direction |\n| **career-biographer** | Competitive context informs personal brand positioning |\n\n---\n\n*Transform competitive chaos into strategic clarity.*\n"
