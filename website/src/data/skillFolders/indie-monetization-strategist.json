Subscription Payments\n\n### Create Subscription Checkout\n\n```typescript\n// pages/api/subscribe.ts\nimport Stripe from 'stripe';\n\nconst stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const { priceId, email, customerId } = req.body;\n\n  try {\n    const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({\n      mode: 'subscription',\n      payment_method_types: ['card'],\n      line_items: [\n        {\n          price: priceId,\n          quantity: 1,\n        },\n      ],\n      customer: customerId, // Existing customer\n      customer_email: customerId ? undefined : email, // Or new customer\n      success_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/dashboard?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,\n      cancel_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/pricing`,\n      subscription_data: {\n        trial_period_days: 14, // Optional free trial\n        metadata: {\n          userId: req.body.userId,\n        },\n      },\n    });\n\n    res.json({ url: session.url });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Customer Portal (Manage Subscriptions)\n\n```typescript\n// pages/api/portal.ts\nimport Stripe from 'stripe';\n\nconst stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  const { customerId } = req.body;\n\n  try {\n    const session = await stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({\n      customer: customerId,\n      return_url: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/dashboard`,\n    });\n\n    res.json({ url: session.url });\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 4. Webhook Handler\n\n### Set Up Webhooks\n\n```typescript\n// pages/api/webhooks/stripe.ts\nimport Stripe from 'stripe';\nimport { buffer } from 'micro';\n\nconst stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!);\n\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: false, // Required for webhook signature verification\n  },\n};\n\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  if (req.method !== 'POST') {\n    return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });\n  }\n\n  const buf = await buffer(req);\n  const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature']!;\n\n  let event: Stripe.Event;\n\n  try {\n    event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(\n      buf,\n      sig,\n      process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!\n    );\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error('Webhook signature verification failed:', err);\n    return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);\n  }\n\n  // Handle specific events\n  switch (event.type) {\n    case 'checkout.session.completed': {\n      const session = event.data.object as Stripe.Checkout.Session;\n      await handleCheckoutComplete(session);\n      break;\n    }\n\n    case 'customer.subscription.created': {\n      const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription;\n      await handleSubscriptionCreated(subscription);\n      break;\n    }\n\n    case 'customer.subscription.updated': {\n      const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription;\n      await handleSubscriptionUpdated(subscription);\n      break;\n    }\n\n    case 'customer.subscription.deleted': {\n      const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription;\n      await handleSubscriptionCanceled(subscription);\n      break;\n    }\n\n    case 'invoice.payment_succeeded': {\n      const invoice = event.data.object as Stripe.Invoice;\n      await handlePaymentSucceeded(invoice);\n      break;\n    }\n\n    case 'invoice.payment_failed': {\n      const invoice = event.data.object as Stripe.Invoice;\n      await handlePaymentFailed(invoice);\n      break;\n    }\n\n    default:\n      console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${event.type}`);\n  }\n\n  res.json({ received: true });\n}\n\n// Handler functions\nasync function handleCheckoutComplete(session: Stripe.Checkout.Session) {\n  const userId = session.metadata?.userId;\n  const customerId = session.customer as string;\n\n  // Grant access to purchased product\n  await db.users.update({\n    where: { id: userId },\n    data: {\n      stripeCustomerId: customerId,\n      hasPurchased: true,\n      purchasedAt: new Date(),\n    },\n  });\n\n  // Send confirmation email\n  await sendEmail({\n    to: session.customer_email!,\n    template: 'purchase-confirmation',\n    data: { session },\n  });\n}\n\nasync function handleSubscriptionCreated(subscription: Stripe.Subscription) {\n  const customerId = subscription.customer as string;\n  const priceId = subscription.items.data[0].price.id;\n\n  await db.subscriptions.create({\n    data: {\n      stripeCustomerId: customerId,\n      stripeSubscriptionId: subscription.id,\n      stripePriceId: priceId,\n      status: subscription.status,\n      currentPeriodEnd: new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000),\n    },\n  });\n}\n\nasync function handleSubscriptionUpdated(subscription: Stripe.Subscription) {\n  await db.subscriptions.update({\n    where: { stripeSubscriptionId: subscription.id },\n    data: {\n      status: subscription.status,\n      stripePriceId: subscription.items.data[0].price.id,\n      currentPeriodEnd: new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000),\n    },\n  });\n}\n\nasync function handleSubscriptionCanceled(subscription: Stripe.Subscription) {\n  await db.subscriptions.update({\n    where: { stripeSubscriptionId: subscription.id },\n    data: {\n      status: 'canceled',\n      canceledAt: new Date(),\n    },\n  });\n\n  // Send cancellation email\n  const customer = await stripe.customers.retrieve(\n    subscription.customer as string\n  );\n  if (customer.email) {\n    await sendEmail({\n      to: customer.email,\n      template: 'subscription-canceled',\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nasync function handlePaymentFailed(invoice: Stripe.Invoice) {\n  const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.retrieve(\n    invoice.subscription as string\n  );\n\n  // Send payment failed email\n  await sendEmail({\n    to: invoice.customer_email!,\n    template: 'payment-failed',\n    data: {\n      amountDue: invoice.amount_due / 100,\n      updatePaymentUrl: `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL}/update-payment`,\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Testing\n\n### Test Mode\n\nAlways use test keys during development:\n- `sk_test_...` for secret key\n- `pk_test_...` for publishable key\n\n### Test Card Numbers\n\n```\n# Successful payments\n4242424242424242 - Visa (success)\n5555555555554444 - Mastercard (success)\n\n# Declined payments\n4000000000000002 - Card declined\n4000000000009995 - Insufficient funds\n\n# 3D Secure\n4000002500003155 - Requires authentication\n\n# Use any future expiry date\n# Use any 3-digit CVC\n```\n\n### Test Webhooks Locally\n\n```bash\n# Install Stripe CLI\nbrew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe\n\n# Login\nstripe login\n\n# Forward webhooks to local server\nstripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe\n\n# Copy the webhook secret (whsec_xxx) to .env.local\n```\n\n## 6. Production Checklist\n\n### Before Going Live\n\n- [ ] Switch to live API keys\n- [ ] Set up production webhook endpoint\n- [ ] Test complete purchase flow\n- [ ] Verify webhook handling for all event types\n- [ ] Set up error alerting (Sentry, etc.)\n- [ ] Configure Stripe receipts and invoices\n- [ ] Add refund handling logic\n- [ ] Set up tax collection if needed (Stripe Tax)\n\n### Security\n\n- [ ] Never expose secret key to client\n- [ ] Verify webhook signatures\n- [ ] Use environment variables for all keys\n- [ ] Enable 3D Secure for fraud prevention\n- [ ] Set up Radar rules for fraud detection\n\n### Legal\n\n- [ ] Display clear pricing (including taxes)\n- [ ] Add terms of service\n- [ ] Add privacy policy\n- [ ] Add refund policy\n- [ ] Display cancellation terms for subscriptions\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Check Subscription Status\n\n```typescript\nasync function checkAccess(userId: string): Promise<boolean> {\n  const user = await db.users.findUnique({\n    where: { id: userId },\n    include: { subscription: true },\n  });\n\n  if (!user?.subscription) return false;\n\n  return (\n    user.subscription.status === 'active' ||\n    user.subscription.status === 'trialing'\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Usage-Based Billing\n\n```typescript\n// Record usage\nawait stripe.subscriptionItems.createUsageRecord(\n  subscriptionItemId,\n  {\n    quantity: apiCallCount,\n    timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),\n    action: 'increment',\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Proration on Plan Changes\n\n```typescript\n// Upgrade subscription\nawait stripe.subscriptions.update(subscriptionId, {\n  items: [\n    {\n      id: existingItemId,\n      price: newPriceId,\n    },\n  ],\n  proration_behavior: 'create_prorations',\n});\n```\n"

Battle-tested strategies for indie developers and solopreneurs.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. **Build audience first** - Email list is your foundation\n2. **Start with validation** - If people won't use it free, they won't pay\n3. **Stack revenue streams** - Multiple small wins beats one moonshot\n4. **Price on value, not cost** - Premium pricing attracts premium customers\n5. **Play the long game** - Most \"overnight\" successes took 3-5 years\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use for:**\n- Choosing monetization models for dev tools\n- Setting up freemium/premium tiers\n- Pricing strategy decisions\n- Email list building for launches\n- Sponsorship and donation systems\n\n**NOT for:**\n- Enterprise B2B sales (use sales skills)\n- VC fundraising/pitch decks\n- Large-scale advertising campaigns\n\n## The Indie Monetization Stack\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│           PREMIUM PRODUCTS                  │\n│  SaaS subscriptions, one-time purchases     │\n│  → Highest revenue, requires product-market │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│           SERVICES & CONSULTING             │\n│  Custom work, implementation, training      │\n│  → Trade time for money, but validates      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│           PASSIVE/SEMI-PASSIVE              │\n│  Sponsorships, donations, affiliates        │\n│  → Lower friction, good for content/tools   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│           LIST BUILDING                     │\n│  Email subscribers, community members       │\n│  → Foundation for all monetization          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Monetization Decision Tree\n\n```\nIs your project...\n\nA DEVELOPER TOOL?\n├── Open source? → Sponsorships + Premium features/hosting\n├── Closed source? → Freemium SaaS or one-time purchase\n└── CLI tool? → Pay-what-you-want + Pro tier\n\nAN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE?\n├── Course/tutorial? → One-time purchase or membership\n├── Reference site? → Sponsorships + Premium content\n└── Interactive app? → Freemium with advanced features\n\nA CONTENT SITE?\n├── Technical blog? → Sponsorships + Newsletter premium tier\n├── Showcase/portfolio? → Consulting leads + Sponsorships\n└── Community site? → Membership + Sponsorships\n```\n\n## Model Quick Reference\n\n### Freemium SaaS (80/20 Rule)\n\n| Tier | Price | What to Include |\n|------|-------|-----------------|\n| **Free** | $0 | Core functionality, usage limits, goal: get users hooked |\n| **Pro** | $9-29/mo | Higher limits, no branding, priority support |\n| **Team** | $49-199/mo | Admin controls, SSO, SLA guarantees |\n\n**Gate these:** Usage volume, team features, white-labeling, advanced analytics\n**Never gate:** Core functionality, security features, basics competitors offer free\n\n### Sponsorship Pricing Formula\n\n```\nMonthly visitors × $0.01-0.05 = Base sponsorship rate\n\nMultipliers:\n+ Developer audience (2-3x)\n+ Niche focus (1.5-2x)\n+ High engagement (1.5x)\n```\n\n### Donation Platforms\n\n| Platform | Best For | Notes |\n|----------|----------|-------|\n| GitHub Sponsors | Developers | Best for OSS |\n| Buy Me a Coffee | Low friction | Quick setup |\n| Ko-fi | Creators | No platform cut |\n| Stripe Links | Direct | Lowest fees |\n\n## Pricing Psychology Essentials\n\n**The Decoy Effect:**\n```\nBASIC: $9    PRO: $29 (target)    ENTERPRISE: $99 (decoy)\n```\n\n**Price Anchoring:**\n```\n❌ \"Only $29/month!\"\n✅ \"$49/month → $29/month (save 40%)\"\n```\n\n**Annual vs Monthly:**\n```\nMonthly: $29/month | Annual: $19/month (billed $228/year)\nAnnual subscribers have 5x lower churn.\n```\n\n## Anti-Patterns (10 Critical Mistakes)\n\n### 1. Premature Monetization\n**Symptom:** Adding payments before product-market fit\n**Fix:** Validate with free users first\n\n### 2. Race to the Bottom Pricing\n**Symptom:** Pricing way below competitors\n**Fix:** Price on value delivered, not competitor copying\n\n### 3. Feature Bloat to Justify Price\n**Symptom:** Adding features nobody asked for\n**Fix:** Charge more for LESS but BETTER\n\n### 4. Ignoring Existing Monetization\n**Symptom:** Building new revenue streams instead of optimizing existing\n**Fix:** 2x conversion rate before adding new streams\n\n### 5. Crippled Free Tier\n**Symptom:** Free tier so limited it's useless\n**Fix:** Users who never experience value never convert\n\n### 6. No Email List\n**Symptom:** Relying only on organic traffic\n**Fix:** Build list before you need it - foundation for everything\n\n### 7. One-Size-Fits-All Pricing\n**Symptom:** Same price for hobbyists and enterprises\n**Fix:** Segment pricing by use case and value\n\n### 8. Hidden Costs\n**Symptom:** Surprise fees after signup\n**Fix:** Transparent pricing builds trust\n\n### 9. Ignoring Churn\n**Symptom:** Focus on acquisition, not retention\n**Fix:** Reducing churn 5% can increase profits 25-95%\n\n### 10. Pricing Too Low\n**Symptom:** Undervaluing your work\n**Fix:** Higher prices = better customers, higher expectations\n\n## Revenue Benchmarks (Indie Scale)\n\n| Stage | Monthly Revenue | Meaning |\n|-------|-----------------|---------|\n| Ramen Profitable | $2-5k | Can quit day job (barely) |\n| Comfortable | $10-20k | Good indie income |\n| Scaling | $50k+ | Time to consider hiring |\n\n**Reality check:** Most indie projects earn $0-500/month. $2k/month = top 10%.\n\n## Quick Implementation\n\n### Add Payments (5 min with Stripe)\n\n```typescript\n// See references/stripe-integration.md for complete guide\nconst session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({\n  mode: 'subscription',\n  line_items: [{ price: 'price_xxx', quantity: 1 }],\n  success_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',\n});\n```\n\n### Add Sponsorship Button\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/yourusername\">\n  <img src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsor-💖-ea4aaa\">\n</a>\n```\n\n### Launch Email Sequence\n\n```\nDay 0: Deliver lead magnet + welcome\nDay 3: Best content piece\nDay 7: Your story/why you built this\nDay 14: Soft pitch\nDay 21: Social proof\nDay 30: Direct pitch with deadline\n```\n\n## Reference Files\n\n| File | Contents |\n|------|----------|\n| `references/pricing-templates.md` | HTML/CSS pricing page templates |\n| `references/email-sequences.md` | Complete email sequence examples |\n| `references/stripe-integration.md` | Full Stripe implementation guide |\n\n---\n\n**Covers:** Monetization Strategy | Pricing Psychology | Freemium | Sponsorships | Email Marketing\n\n**Use with:** content-marketer (distribution) | web-design-expert (pricing pages) | product-strategist (positioning)\n"
