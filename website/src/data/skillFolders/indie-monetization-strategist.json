This skill focuses on realistic, battle-tested monetization strategies for indie developers and solopreneurs.\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use for:**\n- Choosing monetization models for dev tools\n- Setting up freemium/premium tiers\n- Pricing strategy decisions\n- Email list building for launches\n- Sponsorship and donation systems\n- Passive income optimization\n- Content monetization\n\n**NOT for:**\n- Enterprise B2B sales processes\n- VC fundraising/pitch decks\n- Large-scale advertising campaigns\n- Affiliate marketing schemes\n\n## The Indie Monetization Stack\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│           PREMIUM PRODUCTS                  │\n│  SaaS subscriptions, one-time purchases     │\n│  → Highest revenue, requires product-market │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│           SERVICES & CONSULTING             │\n│  Custom work, implementation, training      │\n│  → Trade time for money, but validates      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│           PASSIVE/SEMI-PASSIVE              │\n│  Sponsorships, donations, affiliates        │\n│  → Lower friction, good for content/tools   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│           LIST BUILDING                     │\n│  Email subscribers, community members       │\n│  → Foundation for all monetization          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Monetization Decision Tree\n\n```\nIs your project...\n\nA DEVELOPER TOOL?\n├── Open source? → Sponsorships + Premium features/hosting\n├── Closed source? → Freemium SaaS or one-time purchase\n└── CLI tool? → Pay-what-you-want + Pro tier\n\nAN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE?\n├── Course/tutorial? → One-time purchase or membership\n├── Reference site? → Sponsorships + Premium content\n└── Interactive app? → Freemium with advanced features\n\nA CONTENT SITE?\n├── Technical blog? → Sponsorships + Newsletter premium tier\n├── Showcase/portfolio? → Consulting leads + Sponsorships\n└── Community site? → Membership + Sponsorships\n```\n\n## Model Deep Dives\n\n### Freemium SaaS\n\n**The 80/20 rule**: 80% of users stay free, 20% of free features drive conversion\n\n**Tier structure:**\n```\nFREE TIER (Lead generation)\n- Core functionality works fully\n- Usage limits (not feature gates)\n- Watermarks/branding acceptable\n- Goal: Get users hooked\n\nPRO TIER ($9-29/mo typical)\n- Higher/no usage limits\n- No branding/watermarks\n- Priority support\n- Team features\n- Goal: Convert serious users\n\nTEAM/ENTERPRISE ($49-199/mo)\n- Admin controls\n- SSO/compliance\n- SLA guarantees\n- Goal: Capture business value\n```\n\n**Anti-pattern**: Don't cripple the free tier so much it's useless. Users who never experience value never convert.\n\n**What to gate (good):**\n- Usage volume (API calls, storage, exports)\n- Team collaboration features\n- White-labeling/custom branding\n- Priority support/SLA\n- Advanced analytics\n\n**What NOT to gate (bad):**\n- Core functionality that demonstrates value\n- Basic features competitors offer free\n- Security features (never gate security)\n\n### Sponsorships\n\n**Where to get sponsors:**\n- GitHub Sponsors - For open source projects\n- Open Collective - For community projects\n- Direct outreach - For established projects\n- Sponsorship marketplaces (EthicalAds, Carbon Ads)\n\n**Sponsorship pricing formula:**\n```\nMonthly visitors × $0.01-0.05 = Base sponsorship rate\n\nExample:\n50,000 monthly visitors × $0.02 = $1,000/month potential\n\nFactors that increase rate:\n+ Developer audience (2-3x)\n+ Niche focus (1.5-2x)\n+ High engagement (1.5x)\n+ Multiple placements available (additive)\n```\n\n**Sponsorship tiers template:**\n```markdown\n## Sponsor Some Claude Skills\n\n### 🥉 Bronze - $100/month\n- Logo in README sponsors section\n- Thank you tweet\n\n### 🥈 Silver - $500/month\n- Everything in Bronze\n- Logo on website footer\n- Monthly newsletter mention\n\n### 🥇 Gold - $1,000/month\n- Everything in Silver\n- Logo in documentation sidebar\n- Dedicated sponsor spotlight post\n- Logo in all video content\n\n### 💎 Platinum - $2,500/month\n- Everything in Gold\n- Custom integration example\n- Co-branded content opportunity\n- Direct Slack channel access\n```\n\n### Donations / Pay-What-You-Want\n\n**When donations work:**\n- Strong community/emotional connection\n- Open source with clear value\n- Educational content that helped careers\n- Tools that saved significant time/money\n\n**Platforms:**\n- GitHub Sponsors (best for developers)\n- Buy Me a Coffee (low friction)\n- Ko-fi (creator-friendly)\n- Patreon (for ongoing content)\n- Stripe Payment Links (direct, lowest fees)\n\n**Donation psychology:**\n- Anchor with suggested amounts ($5, $15, $50)\n- Show what donations fund (\"$5 = 1 hour of development\")\n- Thank donors publicly (with permission)\n- Provide exclusive perks for ongoing supporters\n\n### Email List Building\n\n**The foundation of all monetization.** Build your list before you need it.\n\n**Lead magnets for developers:**\n- Cheatsheets/quick reference guides\n- Starter templates/boilerplates\n- Exclusive tutorials/deep dives\n- Early access to new features\n- Behind-the-scenes content\n\n**Email sequence template:**\n```\nDay 0: Welcome + Deliver lead magnet\nDay 3: Your best content piece\nDay 7: Your story/why you built this\nDay 14: Soft pitch (premium feature/product)\nDay 21: Social proof + testimonials\nDay 30: Direct pitch with deadline\n```\n\n**Tools:**\n- Buttondown (developer-focused, simple)\n- ConvertKit (creator economy standard)\n- Mailchimp (free tier, but clunky)\n- Resend (if you want to self-host)\n\n## Pricing Psychology\n\n### The Decoy Effect\n\n```\nBASIC: $9/month\n- Feature A\n- Feature B\n\nPRO: $29/month ← Target\n- Everything in Basic\n- Feature C\n- Feature D\n- Feature E\n\nENTERPRISE: $99/month ← Decoy (makes Pro look reasonable)\n- Everything in Pro\n- Feature F\n- Priority support\n```\n\n### Price Anchoring\n\nAlways show the higher price first, then the discount:\n```\n❌ Bad: \"Only $29/month!\"\n✅ Good: \"$49/month → $29/month (save 40%)\"\n```\n\n### Annual vs Monthly\n\n```\nMonthly: $29/month\nAnnual: $19/month (billed $228/year)\n         ↑\n    Save 34% + lock in users\n\nOffer both, but highlight annual.\nAnnual subscribers have 5x lower churn.\n```\n\n## Platform-Specific Strategies\n\n### For someclaudeskills.com (Skills Marketplace)\n\n**Monetization stack:**\n1. **Sponsorships** - Primary revenue\n   - Sidebar sponsor spots\n   - Newsletter sponsors\n   - \"Featured skill\" placements\n\n2. **Premium skills** - Secondary\n   - Sell premium skill packs\n   - License commercial-use skills\n\n3. **Consulting leads** - Tertiary\n   - \"Need custom skills? Contact us\"\n   - Implementation services\n\n4. **Affiliate** - Passive\n   - Link to Claude Pro/API with affiliate\n   - Related tools and services\n\n### For Educational Apps\n\n**Monetization stack:**\n1. **Freemium with progress gates**\n   - First N lessons free\n   - Full curriculum requires upgrade\n\n2. **One-time purchase option**\n   - Lifetime access at 2-3x annual price\n   - Appeals to commitment-averse users\n\n3. **Certificates/credentials**\n   - Completion certificates (paid)\n   - Portfolio-worthy projects (premium)\n\n### For Developer Tools\n\n**Monetization stack:**\n1. **Open core model**\n   - Core tool free and open source\n   - Paid cloud hosting option\n   - Enterprise features closed source\n\n2. **Usage-based pricing**\n   - Free tier: 1,000 API calls/month\n   - Pro: 50,000 calls for $29/month\n   - Enterprise: Unlimited for $199/month\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns\n\n### Premature Monetization\n**Symptom**: Adding payments before product-market fit\n**Problem**: Optimizing revenue for something nobody wants\n**Solution**: Validate with free users first. If people won't use it free, they won't pay.\n\n### Race to the Bottom Pricing\n**Symptom**: Pricing way below competitors\n**Problem**: Signals low quality, attracts worst customers\n**Solution**: Price based on value delivered, not competitor copying. Premium pricing attracts premium customers.\n\n### Feature Bloat to Justify Price\n**Symptom**: Adding features nobody asked for to justify higher tiers\n**Problem**: Complexity kills products\n**Solution**: Charge more for LESS but BETTER. Simplicity is a feature.\n\n### Ignoring Existing Monetization\n**Symptom**: Building new revenue streams instead of optimizing existing\n**Problem**: Switching costs, divided focus\n**Solution**: 2x your conversion rate before adding new revenue streams.\n\n## Quick Implementation Guides\n\n### Add Stripe Payments (5 minutes)\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Install\nnpm install @stripe/stripe-js stripe\n\n// 2. Create checkout session (API route)\nimport Stripe from 'stripe';\nconst stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);\n\nexport async function POST(req) {\n  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({\n    payment_method_types: ['card'],\n    line_items: [{\n      price: 'price_xxxxx', // Your Stripe price ID\n      quantity: 1,\n    }],\n    mode: 'subscription', // or 'payment' for one-time\n    success_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',\n    cancel_url: 'https://yoursite.com/pricing',\n  });\n  return Response.json({ url: session.url });\n}\n\n// 3. Redirect to checkout\nconst response = await fetch('/api/checkout', { method: 'POST' });\nconst { url } = await response.json();\nwindow.location.href = url;\n```\n\n### Add GitHub Sponsors\n\n1. Go to github.com/sponsors\n2. Set up sponsor profile\n3. Create tiers ($1, $5, $10, $25 suggested)\n4. Add sponsor button to repos\n5. Add sponsors section to README\n\n### Add Buy Me a Coffee\n\n```html\n<!-- Simple button -->\n<a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/yourusername\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png\"\n       alt=\"Buy Me A Coffee\"\n       style=\"height: 60px; width: 217px;\">\n</a>\n```\n\n## Revenue Benchmarks (Indie Scale)\n\n| Stage | Monthly Revenue | What it means |\n|-------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Ramen Profitable | $2-5k | Can quit day job (barely) |\n| Comfortable | $10-20k | Good indie income |\n| Scaling | $50k+ | Time to consider hiring |\n\n**Reality check**: Most indie projects earn $0-500/month. Getting to $2k/month puts you in the top 10% of indie hackers.\n\n## The Patient Path (Cory Zue's Framework)\n\n1. **Start consulting** - Validates skills, builds runway\n2. **Build small products** - $100-1k/month each\n3. **Stack revenue streams** - Multiple small wins\n4. **Find the winner** - One product takes off\n5. **Double down** - Focus on what works\n\n**Key insight**: Most successful indie hackers took 3-5 years to reach \"overnight success.\" Plan for the long game.\n\n## Reference Files\n\n| File | Contents |\n|------|----------|\n| `references/pricing-templates.md` | Copy-paste pricing page templates |\n| `references/email-sequences.md` | Full email sequence examples |\n| `references/stripe-integration.md` | Complete Stripe setup guide |\n\n---\n\n**This skill guides**: Monetization Strategy | Pricing Psychology | Freemium Models | Sponsorships | Email Marketing | Indie Hacker Revenue\n"
