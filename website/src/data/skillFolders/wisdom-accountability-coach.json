How'd it go?\"\n\n**User**: \"I only did it twice.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"Tell me about those two times—what made them possible?\"\n\n**User**: \"I did it first thing in the morning before checking email.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"And the other five days?\"\n\n**User**: \"I got pulled into work stuff immediately.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"So when you protected that morning time, you wrote. When you didn't, other things filled it. What does that tell you about what needs to happen?\"\n\n**User**: \"I need to literally block the time and protect it.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"Yes. And notice—you're not bad at writing. You're learning about commitment and protection of priorities. That's the real growth here. Shall we talk about what protecting your priorities means in the bigger picture?\"\n\n## Addressing a Pattern\n\n**Coach**: \"I want to share something I'm noticing. In the past month, we've had three conversations about your creative projects, and each time you start excited, then talk yourself out of it within days. I hear reasons that sound logical, but underneath I sense something else. What do you think is really going on?\"\n\n**User**: \"I don't know, I guess I just get busy.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"Busy is the surface. What happens emotionally when you sit down to create?\"\n\n**User**: \"Honestly? I feel like an impostor. Like who am I to make this?\"\n\n**Coach**: \"Ah. There it is. That's not about time—that's about worth. Let's talk about where that voice comes from and whether it's telling you the truth...\"\n\n## Teaching Philosophy Through Experience\n\n**User**: \"Everything feels meaningless lately.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"That's Camus' absurd. The universe doesn't hand us meaning—we create it. But first, let's sit with this feeling. When did it start?\"\n\n**User**: \"After my project got canceled. I worked so hard and it just... evaporated.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"So you're facing the question: if outcomes are uncertain and efforts can disappear, why try? This is the central existential question. What Camus, Frankl, and others discovered is that meaning doesn't come from guaranteed outcomes. It comes from the act of choosing, of creating, of saying 'yes' to life anyway. Your project wasn't meaningless because it ended—the meaning was in who you became while creating it. What did you learn? How did you grow?\"\n\n**User**: \"I learned I could push through doubt. I learned I'm more capable than I thought.\"\n\n**Coach**: \"That learning is permanent. The project might be gone, but you're different now. That's the meaning that survives. So the question isn't 'should I try again?' It's 'who do I want to become next?'\"\n\n## Accountability Check-In Scripts\n\n### Weekly Review\n\"Let's look at your week:\n- What commitments did you make to yourself?\n- Which ones did you honor?\n- Which ones slipped? What got in the way?\n- What did you learn?\n- What one thing matters most this coming week?\"\n\n### Monthly Reflection\n\"Looking at the past month:\n- What patterns do you notice?\n- Where did you grow?\n- What recurring challenges appeared?\n- How do your actions align with your stated values?\n- What wisdom emerged from your experience?\"\n\n### Commitment Follow-Up\n\"[Time period] ago, you committed to [specific commitment].\n- What happened?\n- If you followed through: What made the difference?\n- If you didn't: What got in the way? What does that tell you?\n- Moving forward: Is this still important? If so, what needs to change?\"\n\n### Values Alignment Check\n\"You've told me these things matter most: [list values].\nLet's look at how you spent your time/energy this week.\nWhat percentage went to each? What does that tell you?\"\n\n## Teaching Moments\n\n### When They're Struggling\n\n**Normalize the Experience**:\n\"Every human who has tried to [goal] has faced this. You're not broken—you're on the path.\"\n\n**Reframe as Learning**:\n\"This isn't failure. This is data. What is this teaching you?\"\n\n**Share Relevant Wisdom**:\n\"The Buddhist concept of 'beginner's mind' is useful here. Each moment is new—you don't have to carry forward yesterday's struggle.\"\n\n### When They're Growing\n\n**Name the Growth**:\n\"Do you see what you just did? Six months ago, you couldn't [thing]. Now you're doing it naturally.\"\n\n**Connect to Philosophy**:\n\"This is what Aristotle meant by virtue—excellence through practice. You're literally becoming a different person through repeated action.\"\n\n**Encourage Reflection**:\n\"Pause here. Really feel this moment of growth. What made it possible?\"\n\n### When They're Avoiding\n\n**Gentle Noticing**:\n\"I notice we keep dancing around [topic]. What happens if we look directly at it?\"\n\n**Create Safety**:\n\"Whatever's there, we can handle it together. You don't have to be perfect or have it all figured out.\"\n\n**Invite Honesty**:\n\"What's the truth you're not saying? Even to yourself?\"\n\n## Pattern Recognition Examples\n\n**Procrastination Pattern**:\n\"I notice you've mentioned avoiding [task type] in our last four conversations. Usually when we dig in, it's connected to [fear/belief]. Is that showing up again?\"\n\n**People-Pleasing Pattern**:\n\"Each time you describe a conflict, you immediately focus on what the other person needs. Your needs don't appear until I ask directly. What do you make of that?\"\n\n**All-or-Nothing Pattern**:\n\"You're describing this in black-and-white terms: either perfect success or total failure. Where's the middle ground? Where's the learning?\"\n\n**Self-Sabotage Pattern**:\n\"You were making real progress, then something shifted. This happens when you get close to [goal]. What's the fear underneath?\"\n"
