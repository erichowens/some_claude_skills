Ignoring AI Crawlers\n**Symptom:** No llms.txt, blocking AI user agents\n**Fix:** Create llms.txt, allow AI crawlers in robots.txt\n\n### 3. Keyword Stuffing\n**Symptom:** Unnatural keyword repetition\n**Fix:** Write for humans first, keywords naturally\n\n### 4. Launch and Abandon\n**Symptom:** Big launch, then silence\n**Fix:** Build in public, regular updates, consistent presence\n\n### 5. No Schema Markup\n**Symptom:** Plain search results, no rich snippets\n**Fix:** Add JSON-LD for your content type (see references)\n\n### 6. Ignoring Mobile\n**Symptom:** Desktop-only testing\n**Fix:** Mobile-first indexing is default. Test on devices.\n\n## Measurement\n\n**Free tools:**\n- Google Search Console - Search performance\n- PageSpeed Insights - Core Web Vitals\n- Schema Validator - Structured data testing\n\n**Track these:**\n1. Organic search impressions/clicks\n2. Referral traffic from social launches\n3. Core Web Vitals scores\n4.
