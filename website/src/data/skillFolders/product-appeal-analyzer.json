This reference catalogs the signals that communicate \"this is for people like you.\"\n\n## The Identity Principle\n\n**Users don't choose the best product—they choose the product that feels most made for them.**\n\nIdentity signals answer:\n- \"Is this for people like me?\"\n- \"Will people like me be represented?\"\n- \"Does using this align with who I want to be?\"\n\n## Signal Categories\n\n### 1.

The complement to friction analysis.\n\n**Core insight**: Users don't choose the best product—they choose the product that feels most like it was made for them.\n\n## When to Use\n\n✅ **Use for:**\n- Evaluating landing pages, product pages, app store listings\n- Positioning a product against alternatives\n- Crafting messaging, tone, visual identity direction\n- Assessing emotional resonance with target personas\n- Pre-launch \"will this convert?\" analysis\n\n❌ **NOT for:**\n- UX friction audits (→ use ux-friction-analyzer)\n- Visual design execution (→ use web-design-expert)\n- A/B test implementation (→ use frontend-developer)\n- Market size estimation or financial forecasting\n- Feature comparison matrices\n\n---\n\n## The Desirability Triangle\n\n**All three must be present.** Missing any one kills conversion:\n\n```\n                    IDENTITY FIT\n                    \"This is for people like me\"\n                         /\\\n                        /  \\\n                       /    \\\n                      /  ★   \\\n                     / DESIRE \\\n                    /          \\\n                   /______________\\\n        PROBLEM               TRUST\n        URGENCY               SIGNALS\n   \"I need this now\"     \"This will actually work\"\n```\n\n| Missing Element | User Reaction |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Identity Fit | \"Seems useful, but not for me\" |\n| Problem Urgency | \"Cool, maybe someday\" |\n| Trust Signals | \"Looks sketchy / too good to be true\" |\n\n**Decision tree**: When analyzing, score each vertex 1-10. If any is &lt;5, that's your priority fix.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Analysis: The 5-Second Test\n\nWithin 5 seconds of landing, a visitor should know:\n\n1. **What is this?** (Category recognition)\n2. **Who is it for?** (Identity signal)\n3. **What's the core promise?** (Value proposition)\n4. **What do I do next?** (Clear CTA)\n\n**How to run it:**\n- Show landing page to someone unfamiliar for exactly 5 seconds\n- Hide it, then ask: \"What was that? Who's it for? What would you do there?\"\n- Record verbatim—don't coach or clarify\n\n**Scoring:**\n\n| Result | Score | Action |\n|--------|-------|--------|\n| All 4 clear in &lt;3 sec | 9-10 | Ship it |\n| All 4 clear in 3-5 sec | 7-8 | Minor polish |\n| 3 of 4 clear | 5-6 | Fix the gap |\n| 2 or fewer clear | 2-4 | Significant rework |\n| Confusing/unclear | 0-1 | Start over |\n\n---\n\n## Analysis Process\n\n### Step 1: Identify Target Personas\n\nFor each persona, document:\n- **Who**: One-sentence description\n- **Problem**: What's broken + how it feels\n- **Current workaround**: What they do today (and why it sucks)\n- **Identity**: How they see themselves, who they want to become\n\n### Step 2: Score the Desirability Triangle\n\nFor each persona:\n\n```\nPERSONA: [Name]\n\nIDENTITY FIT                    [/10]\n  Visual identity match         [/10]  \"Does this look like my kind of tool?\"\n  Language resonance            [/10]  \"Do they speak my language?\"\n  Implied user match            [/10]  \"Are people like me shown?\"\n\nPROBLEM URGENCY                 [/10]\n  Pain point acknowledged       [/10]  \"They understand my problem\"\n  Emotional resonance           [/10]  \"They get how frustrating it is\"\n  Solution clarity              [/10]  \"I see how this fixes it\"\n\nTRUST SIGNALS                   [/10]\n  Professional execution        [/10]  \"This looks legitimate\"\n  Social proof                  [/10]  \"Others like me use it\"\n  Risk reduction                [/10]  \"What if it doesn't work?\"\n\nOVERALL APPEAL SCORE:           [/90]\n```\n\n### Step 3: Map Objections\n\n| Objection | Type | How Addressed? |\n|-----------|------|----------------|\n| \"Is this legit?\" | Trust | [Answer] |\n| \"I've tried things before\" | Skepticism | [Answer] |\n| \"Too expensive\" | Value | [Answer] |\n| \"Too complicated\" | Effort | [Answer] |\n| \"Not for people like me\" | Identity | [Answer] |\n| \"What if it doesn't work?\" | Risk | [Answer] |\n| \"I'll do it later\" | Urgency | [Answer] |\n\n### Step 4: Generate Recommendations\n\nUse priority formula: `Impact = (Users Affected × Severity) / Fix Difficulty`\n\nCategorize into:\n- **Immediate** (ship this week)\n- **Medium-term** (this sprint)\n- **Long-term** (roadmap)\n\n---\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns\n\n### Feature Soup Headline\n\n**Novice thinking**: \"List all capabilities to show value\"\n\n**Reality**: Visitors scan for 2-3 seconds. Feature lists feel generic.\n\n**What to use instead**:\n| Bad | Good |\n|-----|------|\n| \"AI-Powered Recovery Planning Tool with Analytics\" | \"Know exactly what to do next in your recovery\" |\n| \"Comprehensive Legal Document Platform\" | \"Find out in 2 minutes if your record can be expunged\" |\n\n**Detection**: Headline contains 3+ nouns or buzzwords like \"AI-powered\", \"comprehensive\", \"platform\"\n\n### Screenshot Hero\n\n**Novice thinking**: \"Show the product interface so people know what they're getting\"\n\n**Reality**: Strangers don't understand your UI. They care about outcomes.\n\n**What to use instead**:\n- Person experiencing the benefit\n- The outcome/result they'll get\n- Abstract visualization of the transformation\n\n**Detection**: Hero image is a product screenshot with no context\n\n### Trust Ladder Violation\n\n**Novice thinking**: \"Get their email immediately, then convert them\"\n\n**Reality**: Trust builds in stages. Asking for too much too early kills conversion.\n\n**The Trust Ladder** (each rung requires more trust):\n1. Land on page → Professional design, no broken elements\n2. Click/explore → Clear navigation, fast load\n3. Spend &gt;2 min → Demonstrated value, clear progress\n4. Enter info → Why you need it explained, no dark patterns\n5. Create account → Privacy visible, minimal fields, clear benefit\n6. Pay money → Guarantee, testimonials, recognizable processor\n\n**Detection**: Asking for account creation before demonstrating value\n\n### Identity Mismatch\n\n**Novice thinking**: \"Broad appeal = more users\"\n\n**Reality**: When everyone is the target, no one feels targeted.\n\n**What to use instead**:\n| Signal Type | How It Works |\n|-------------|--------------|\n| Visual identity | Dark mode = \"power user\"; Soft pastels = \"wellness\" |\n| Language/tone | \"Crush your goals\" vs \"Find your balance\" |\n| Social proof | Company logos vs individual testimonials |\n| Complexity | Minimal = simplicity-seeker; Feature-rich = power user |\n\n**Detection**: Homepage tries to appeal to 3+ different personas\n\n---\n\n## Self-Contained Tools\n\n### Analysis Workflow\n\n1. **Read** the landing page content and structure\n2. **WebFetch** the target URL to analyze live content\n3. **Write** analysis results to a markdown file\n4. **Edit** recommendations into actionable copy changes\n\n### Appeal Scorer Script\n\nRun: `python scripts/appeal_scorer.py <url>`\n\nProduces structured JSON output with scores and recommendations.\n\n### Reference Files (See for deep dives)\n\n| File | When to Use |\n|------|-------------|\n| `references/scoring-templates.md` | Full scoring matrices and templates |\n| `references/trust-ladder.md` | Deep dive on trust building stages |\n| `references/identity-signals.md` | Visual/verbal identity signal catalog |\n| `references/objection-catalog.md` | Common objections by product type |\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\nWhen running this skill, produce:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** - 3 bullet key findings\n2. **Desirability Triangle Scores** - Per persona\n3. **5-Second Test Assessment** - What's clear, what's not\n4. **Top 3 Objections** - And how to address them\n5. **Priority Recommendations** - Immediate / Medium / Long-term\n\n---\n\n## Integration with ux-friction-analyzer\n\n**Appeal + Friction = Complete picture**\n\n| This Skill Answers | ux-friction-analyzer Answers |\n|--------------------|------------------------------|\n| \"Do they want it?\" | \"Can they use it?\" |\n| Will they choose this over alternatives? | Can they complete the task? |\n| Does it feel made for them? | Does the flow make sense? |\n| Is the promise compelling? | Is the experience smooth? |\n\n**Run both**: High appeal + high friction = frustrated users. Low friction + low appeal = abandoned product.\n\n---\n\n**Philosophy**: A product with low friction but low appeal gets abandoned. A product with high appeal but high friction gets frustrated users. You need both.\n"
