Export in requested formats (PDF, DOCX, JSON Resume)\n```\n\n**Key principle**: ATS compatibility first, human readability second, visual flair never.\n\n## Core Capabilities\n\n### 1. Multi-Format Generation\n| Format | Use Case |\n|--------|----------|\n| PDF | Email applications, job boards, print |\n| DOCX | Recruiter submissions, editable |\n| JSON Resume | Developer portfolios, programmatic |\n| HTML | Portfolio websites, responsive |\n| Markdown | Version control, git-based management |\n| LaTeX | Academic CVs (optional) |\n\n### 2. ATS Optimization Engine\n- Keyword analysis and matching from job descriptions\n- Formatting validation (single-column, standard fonts)\n- Scoring system (0-100) with specific recommendations\n- Parsing simulation\n\n### 3. Template System\n\n| Template | Best For |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Modern Minimalist** | Tech roles (Engineers, Data Scientists) |\n| **Professional Traditional** | Finance, Legal, Senior Executives |\n| **Creative Hybrid** | Design Engineers, UX Researchers |\n| **Academic CV** | PhD, Professors, Researchers |\n\n## ATS Score Breakdown\n\n| Category | Points | Criteria |\n|----------|--------|----------|\n| Formatting | 30 | Single-column, standard fonts, no graphics |\n| Structure | 20 | Summary, Skills, Experience, Education present |\n| Content | 30 | Proper lengths, skills count, metrics in bullets |\n| Keywords | 20 | Job description coverage (or 15 for general) |\n\n**Target**: 85+ out of 100\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Use for:**\n- Creating resume from career-biographer data\n- Optimizing resume for specific job posting\n- Generating multiple resume variants\n- ATS score and improvement recommendations\n- Multi-format export\n\n**Do NOT use for:**\n- Cover letters (different format)\n- Portfolio websites (use web-design-expert)\n- LinkedIn profile optimization\n- Interview preparation\n- Career counseling or job search strategy\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### Anti-Pattern: Creative Resume for Tech Roles\n**What it looks like**: Colorful infographics, skill bars, profile photo, two-column layout\n**Why wrong**: ATS systems can't parse graphics or complex layouts\n**Instead**: Use Minimalist template with clean, single-column text format\n\n### Anti-Pattern: Generic Objective Statement\n**What it looks like**: \"Seeking a challenging role in a growth-oriented company...\"\n**Why wrong**: Wastes space, provides no information\n**Instead**: Professional summary with specific metrics and target role\n\n### Anti-Pattern: Listing Every Technology Ever Used\n**What it looks like**: 40+ skills including outdated technologies\n**Why wrong**: Dilutes expertise, unclear proficiency\n**Instead**: List 15-20 most relevant skills for target role\n\n### Anti-Pattern: Responsibilities Without Outcomes\n**What it looks like**: \"Managed a team\", \"Worked on backend systems\"\n**Why wrong**: Doesn't show impact or value\n**Instead**: \"Led team of 5 to deliver microservices migration, reducing deployment time by 70%\"\n\n### Anti-Pattern: Inconsistent Formatting\n**What it looks like**: Mixed date formats, different bullet styles, varying fonts\n**Why wrong**: Looks unprofessional, confuses ATS parsers\n**Instead**: Strict consistency throughout\n\n## Troubleshooting Quick Reference\n\n| Issue | Cause | Fix |\n|-------|-------|-----|\n| ATS Score &lt;70 | Complex formatting, graphics | Switch to Minimalist, remove images |\n| Keyword Coverage &lt;60% | Not tailoring to job description | Extract keywords, add to Core Skills |\n| Exceeds 2 pages | Too verbose, old roles included | Consolidate old roles, limit bullets |\n| Generic summary | No positioning insights | Include specific metric, state target role |\n| Long bullets | Trying to explain entire project | Split into multiple bullets, focus on outcome |\n\n## Length Guidelines\n\n| Experience | Pages |\n|------------|-------|\n| Entry-level (0-3 years) | 1 page |\n| Mid-level (3-10 years) | 1-2 pages |\n| Senior-level (10+ years) | 2 pages max |\n\n**Never exceed 2 pages**, even for very senior roles.\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- `references/resume-protocol.md` - Complete 8-step generation protocol, ATS scoring, before/after examples\n- `references/formatting-rules.md` - Best practices, templates, output formats, success metrics\n- `references/interfaces-integration.md` - TypeScript interfaces, multi-skill workflows\n\n---\n\n**Core insight**: ATS compatibility first—the best-written resume is worthless if it never reaches human eyes.\n\n**Use with**: career-biographer (content) | competitive-cartographer (positioning) | web-design-expert (portfolio)\n"
