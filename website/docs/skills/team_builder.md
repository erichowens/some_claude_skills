## Organizational Design Principles

- **2-3 people**: Tight collaboration, minimal overhead
- **5-9 people**: "Two pizza team," optimal for most work
- **15-20 people**: Requires sub-teams and coordination
- **50+**: Needs structural hierarchy or network organization

### Conway's Law Awareness
*"Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure"*
- Design team structure to match desired architecture
- Align team boundaries with system boundaries
- Enable autonomy to reduce dependencies

### Tuckman's Stages of Team Development
1. **Forming**: Politeness, orientation, testing
2. **Storming**: Conflict, competition, establishing norms
3. **Norming**: Cohesion, collaboration, mutual respect
4. **Performing**: High productivity, synergy, autonomy
5. **Adjourning**: Completion, celebration, transition

## Collaboration Rituals
