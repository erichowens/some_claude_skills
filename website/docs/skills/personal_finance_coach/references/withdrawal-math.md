# Withdrawal Mathematics

## The Trinity Study (Updated Research)

```
ORIGINAL TRINITY STUDY (Cooley, Hubbard, Walz, 1998):
├── Analyzed 1926-1995 data
├── 30-year retirement periods
├── Various stock/bond allocations
└── Conclusion: 4% withdrawal rate had ~95% success

UPDATED RESEARCH (Bengen, Kitces, ERN, etc.):

VARIABLE SWR BY STARTING VALUATION:
├── CAPE under 12: 5.0%+ SWR historically safe
├── CAPE 12-18: 4.0% SWR historically safe
├── CAPE 18-25: 3.5% SWR more prudent
├── CAPE over 25: 3.0-3.5% SWR recommended
└── Current CAPE (2024): ~33 → Be conservative

DYNAMIC WITHDRAWAL STRATEGIES:

1. GUYTON-KLINGER GUARDRAILS:
   ├── Start at 4-5%
   ├── If withdrawal rate rises 20% above initial: cut 10%
   ├── If withdrawal rate falls 20% below initial: raise 10%
   └── Higher initial rate, but flexibility required

2. VPW (Variable Percentage Withdrawal):
   ├── Recalculate each year based on:
   │   remaining_years = life_expectancy - current_age
   │   withdrawal = portfolio / remaining_years
   ├── Adjusts for portfolio performance
   └── Never runs out, but income varies

3. CAPE-BASED WITHDRAWAL:
   ├── SWR = 1 / (CAPE × 0.5)
   ├── When CAPE = 20: SWR = 1 / 10 = 10%... too high
   ├── Better: SWR = min(5%, 1/CAPE + 1%)
   └── Adjusts to market valuation

## Monte Carlo Retirement Simulation

```python
def simulate_retirement(portfolio: float, allocation: tuple,
                       withdrawal_rate: float, years: int = 30,
                       simulations: int = 10000) -> dict:
    """
    Monte Carlo retirement simulation.

    Args:
        portfolio: Starting portfolio value
        allocation: (stocks_pct, bonds_pct)
        withdrawal_rate: Initial withdrawal as % of portfolio
        years: Retirement length
        simulations: Number of Monte Carlo runs

    Returns:
        Success rate, median ending value, percentiles

## FIRE Calculations

```
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE NUMBER

STANDARD: Annual Expenses × 25
(Assumes 4% SWR)

CONSERVATIVE: Annual Expenses × 33
(Assumes 3% SWR, more appropriate today)

FAT FIRE: Annual Expenses × 33 + Buffer
├── Includes luxury spending
├── Healthcare buffer
├── "Nice to have" budget
└── Typically $2.5M+

LEAN FIRE: Minimal Expenses × 25
├── Bare bones budget
├── Geographic arbitrage
├── $500K - $1M range
└── Less margin for error

COAST FIRE:
├── Save enough that growth alone funds retirement
├── Formula: FI_number / (1 + growth_rate)^years_to_retirement
├── Example: Need $2M at 65, currently 35
│   └── Coast number: $2M / 1.07^30 = $263K
└── After hitting coast number, can reduce savings rate

BARISTA FIRE:
├── Enough to part-time work for benefits
├── Portfolio covers most expenses
├── Job covers health insurance + discretionary
└── Common: $500K-$1M + part-time income
```
