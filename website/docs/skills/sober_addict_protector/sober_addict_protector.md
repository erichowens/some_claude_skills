## High-Risk Situation Recognition

### The HALTS+ Warning Signs

```
H - HUNGRY
├── Blood sugar drops trigger irritability and poor decisions
├── Skipping meals is a warning sign
└── Action: Eat something nutritious within 30 minutes

A - ANGRY
├── Unprocessed anger is a major relapse trigger
├── "I deserve to use" thinking emerges
└── Action: Call someone, write it out, move your body

L - LONELY
├── Isolation is the petri dish of relapse
├── "No one understands" thinking
└── Action: Reach out even when you don't want to

T - TIRED
├── Exhaustion erodes willpower
├── Decision-making suffers
└── Action: Rest if possible, reduce demands on yourself

S - STRESSED
├── Chronic stress depletes coping resources
├── "I need to take the edge off"
└── Action: Use stress reduction skills, reassess workload

+ SICK
├── Physical illness triggers vulnerability
├── Be extra careful with prescribed medications
└── Action: Tell your doctor about your recovery status
```

### High-Risk Environment Checklist

```
Before entering ANY environment, ask:

☐ Will substances be present?
☐ Will people who use be there?
☐ Can I leave if I need to?
☐ Does anyone know where I am?
☐ Do I have my escape plan?
☐ What's my reason for going?
☐ Am I in a good headspace?

If more than 2 boxes are concerning → RECONSIDER or PREPARE HEAVILY
```

## Relapse Prevention Strategies

### The 3 D's: Delay, Distract, Decide

```
When craving hits:

1. DELAY (15-30 minutes)
   ├── Cravings peak and pass
   ├── Set a timer if needed
   └── "I'll decide in 20 minutes"

2. DISTRACT
   ├── Physical activity (even a walk)
   ├── Call someone in recovery
   ├── Cold water on face/hands
   ├── Play the tape forward
   └── Change your environment

3. DECIDE (from a calmer place)
   ├── "Is this what I really want?"
   ├── "What happens tomorrow?"
   └── "What would future me thank me for?"
```

### Play the Tape Forward

```
When romanticizing use:

"If I use right now..."
├── First 10 minutes: [brief relief, familiar feeling]
├── 1 hour later: [guilt, shame, hiding it]
├── Tomorrow: [hangover/withdrawal, broken promises]
├── 1 week later: [deeper hole, more damage]
├── 1 month later: [possibly back where I started or worse]

Now ask: "Is the first 10 minutes worth all that follows?"
```

### Urge Surfing Script

```
"I notice I'm having a craving."
"This is uncomfortable, but it's just a feeling."
"I'm going to observe it without fighting it."

Rate intensity: [1-10]
Where do I feel it? [body location]

"I'm breathing into this sensation."
"Like a wave, it will rise... peak... and fall."
"I don't have to act on it."
"I'm just going to wait and watch."

[After 15-30 minutes]
"The intensity has shifted to: [1-10]"
"I survived this without using."
"Every time I do this, I get stronger."
```

## The Case for Couples Therapy

### Why It's Not Optional

```
If you're in a relationship and in recovery:

THE REALITY:
├── Your addiction affected your partner
├── Trust was damaged
├── Communication patterns are broken
├── Your partner may have their own trauma
├── Codependency patterns need addressing
├── Recovery changes the relationship dynamic
└── BOTH of you need support

THE RISK OF SKIPPING:
├── Unaddressed resentment builds
├── Partner may not know how to support you
├── Old patterns repeat
├── Relationship stress → relapse trigger
├── Partner burnout → relationship failure
└── Kids (if any) see unhealthy patterns continue

THE BENEFIT OF INVESTING:
├── Structured space to rebuild trust
├── Learn healthy communication
├── Process hurt WITH professional support
├── Both partners feel heard
├── Build a relationship that SUPPORTS recovery
└── Model healthy relationships for children
```

### "We Can't Afford It" - Options

```
Financial barriers are real. Here are options:

├── Ask your treatment center for referrals
├── Community mental health centers (sliding scale)
├── Training clinics at universities (supervised students)
├── EAP through employer (often free sessions)
├── Online therapy (often cheaper)
├── Group couples therapy (if available)
├── Al-Anon/Nar-Anon + your program (free, different from therapy)
└── INVEST what you would have spent on substances

Key truth: The cost of NOT doing couples therapy
           often exceeds the cost of divorce.
```

### When to Start

```
General timeline:
├── First 30 days: Focus on individual stability
├── 30-90 days: May introduce family/couples work if stable
├── After 90 days: Couples therapy becomes more important

Signs you need it NOW:
├── Partner threatening to leave
├── Constant conflict at home
├── Partner is triggered by your recovery activities
├── Communication has completely broken down
├── One or both of you are "walking on eggshells"
```

## Individual Therapy Investment

### Why Weekly Therapy Matters

```
"I'm in meetings/groups, why do I need individual therapy?"

Groups provide:
├── Peer support
├── Accountability
├── Shared experience
└── Community

Individual therapy provides:
├── Personalized attention to YOUR patterns
├── Trauma processing (can't do deeply in groups)
├── Underlying issues (anxiety, depression, ADHD)
├── Skill building specific to your triggers
└── Privacy for sensitive topics

BOTH are important. They're not interchangeable.
```

### Common Therapy Resistances

```
"I don't need therapy, I just need to stay sober"
→ Underlying issues will resurface if not addressed
→ Many people relapse because they stop at abstinence

"I can't be that vulnerable"
→ Vulnerability in a safe space builds strength
→ Start slow, trust builds over time

"It's too expensive"
→ What does a relapse cost? (Money, relationships, job, health)
→ Explore sliding scale options

"I don't click with my therapist"
→ Finding the right fit matters
→ It's okay to try different therapists
→ But also give it a few sessions before deciding
```

## Daily Protective Habits

### Non-Negotiables for Early Recovery

```
THE BIG 5 (do these every single day):
├── 1. Connect with recovery support
│      (meeting, sponsor call, recovery friend)
├── 2. Recovery reading or reflection
│      (10 minutes minimum)
├── 3. Physical movement
│      (exercise, walk, any movement)
├── 4. Regular meals
│      (blood sugar stability = emotional stability)
└── 5. Consistent sleep schedule
       (sleep deprivation is a major risk factor)
```

### Weekly Protective Actions

```
WEEKLY MINIMUMS:
├── At least 3 meetings/support groups
├── Sponsor/mentor contact
├── Therapy session (if in individual)
├── Self-care activity (not screens)
├── Review your relapse prevention plan
└── Check in on home relationship health
```

## Close Call Processing

### After a Near-Miss

```
If you came close to using but didn't:

FIRST: You didn't use. Acknowledge that.

THEN PROCESS:
├── What was the trigger?
├── What warning signs did I miss?
├── What eventually stopped me?
├── What can I learn from this?
├── Who do I need to tell? (sponsor, therapist)
└── What needs to change to prevent next time?

IMPORTANT:
├── A close call is NOT failure
├── It's information
├── Don't shame yourself into silence
├── Tell someone who will support, not judge
└── Update your relapse prevention plan
```

### Lapse vs. Relapse

```
LAPSE: A brief return to use followed by return to recovery
RELAPSE: Full return to addictive patterns

If you lapse:
├── Stop using immediately
├── Tell someone (sponsor, therapist, trusted person)
├── Don't "might as well" continue
├── Get back to recovery activities TODAY
├── Increase support temporarily
└── Process what happened without shame

Key: A lapse doesn't have to become a relapse.
     But secrecy and shame fuel progression.
```

## Relationship Red Flags

### Signs Your Relationship May Be Triggering

```
CONCERNING PATTERNS:
├── Partner brings substances into the home
├── Partner dismisses your recovery ("one drink won't hurt")
├── Constant conflict without resolution
├── Walking on eggshells around each other
├── Partner hasn't addressed their own issues
├── Mutual resentment building
├── You hide things from partner
├── Partner controls your recovery activities
└── Feeling worse at home than in treatment

WHAT TO DO:
├── Name the pattern to yourself
├── Discuss with counselor/sponsor first
├── Request couples therapy
├── Set clear boundaries
├── Assess if the relationship supports or threatens recovery
└── Remember: Your recovery must be protected
```

## Anti-Patterns

### "I'm Cured" Thinking
**Pattern**: After feeling good for a while, believing you've beat addiction.
**Danger**: Leads to dropping recovery activities, thinking you can moderate.
**Reality**: Recovery is ongoing. The "cured" feeling is a success of recovery, not its conclusion.

### "I Don't Need Support Anymore"
**Pattern**: Stopping meetings, therapy, sponsor contact because "I've got this."
**Danger**: Isolation returns, skills atrophy, support network fades.
**Reality**: Connection is protective, not remedial. Maintain it.

### "Just This Once"
**Pattern**: Rationalizing one-time use for a special occasion or to "test" yourself.
**Danger**: Addiction doesn't work that way. One use can trigger cascade.
**Reality**: There's no "just this once" for a brain with addiction patterns.

### "My Recovery Is Personal"
**Pattern**: Refusing to tell partner, family, or close friends about recovery.
**Danger**: Secrecy breeds shame; uninformed people can't support you.
**Reality**: Appropriate disclosure to close people increases success.

## Integration Points

**Core Philosophy**: Relapse is not required in recovery, but close calls are common. This skill exists to help you see risks before they become crises, maintain the practices that protect you, and remember that investing in therapy—especially couples therapy—is not optional if you want long-term recovery AND relationships.

Every day sober is a day won. Protect it.
