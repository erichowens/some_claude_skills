## Dream Analysis Method

```
JUNG'S APPROACH TO DREAMS

"The dream is a little hidden door in the innermost and most secret
recesses of the soul." - CW 10, para 304

INTERPRETATION LEVELS

1. OBJECTIVE LEVEL
   └── Dream figures = actual people/situations in waking life
   └── Ask: "What does this person actually represent to me?"

2. SUBJECTIVE LEVEL
   └── Dream figures = aspects of dreamer's psyche
   └── Every character is a part of YOU
   └── Most useful for individuation work

3. ARCHETYPAL LEVEL
   └── Dream connects to collective/mythological patterns
   └── Use amplification to find parallels
   └── "Big dreams" - numinous, memorable for years

AMPLIFICATION METHOD
├── Personal associations (dreamer's own)
├── Cultural associations (what would this mean in their culture?)
├── Archetypal parallels (myths, fairy tales, religious symbols)
└── Direct experience (active imagination with dream image)

DREAM SERIES > SINGLE DREAMS
├── Track motifs over time
├── Look for compensation patterns
├── Note what changes and what persists
└── Dreams comment on previous dreams
```

## Active Imagination Protocol

```
ACTIVE IMAGINATION (differentiated from fantasy)

"The essential thing is to differentiate oneself from these unconscious
contents by personifying them, and at the same time to bring them into
relationship with consciousness." - CW 7, para 342

STEPS

1. INVOCATION
   ├── Begin with an image (from dream, emotion, or body sensation)
   ├── Quiet the ego but don't extinguish it
   └── Hold "alert passivity"

2. ENGAGEMENT
   ├── Allow the image to move, speak, act
   ├── DO NOT direct or control
   ├── Ego remains present as witness AND participant
   └── Ask questions, respond genuinely

3. ETHICAL STANDPOINT
   ├── Ego must maintain values
   ├── You can disagree with the figure
   ├── Don't be swallowed by the unconscious
   └── "The unconscious is not God" - ego maintains responsibility

4. EMBODIMENT
   ├── Record the experience (writing, painting, movement)
   ├── Give it form in outer world
   └── Art-making as psychological work

5. INTEGRATION
   ├── What does this mean for my life?
   ├── What action does it call for?
   └── How does this change my conscious position?

DANGERS
├── Psychotic dissolution (wrong for some patients)
├── Ego inflation (identifying with archetypal images)
├── Passive fantasy (entertainment, not dialogue)
└── Aesthetic distraction (making "art" vs. psychological work)
```

## Practical Exercises

### Shadow Work Journal Protocol

```
DAILY SHADOW INVENTORY (15 min)

EVENING REVIEW:
1. When did I have a strong reaction today?
   - Irritation, judgment, attraction, envy, contempt
   - Note the specific trigger

2. What quality in the other activated me?
   - Name it precisely
   - "They were so [arrogant/needy/controlling/etc.]"

3. Where might this quality live in me?
   - When have I been this way?
   - Where might I be this way unconsciously?
   - What would it be like to own this quality?

4. What might be the gold in this shadow?
   - Arrogance → confidence, self-worth
   - Neediness → capacity for intimacy
   - Controlling → leadership, competence

WEEKLY INTEGRATION:
- Review week's entries
- Look for patterns
- Select one quality for active imagination work
```
