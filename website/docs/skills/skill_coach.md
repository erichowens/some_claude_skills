This meta-skill helps you create Agent Skills that encode real domain expertise, not just surface-level instructions. It focuses on the **shibboleths** - the deep knowledge that separates novices from experts.

## Your Mission

Create skills that are progressive disclosure machines encoding temporal knowledge, anti-patterns, and expert-level domain understanding.

## What Makes a Great Skill

Great skills:
1. **Encode temporal knowledge** - "This worked pre-2024, but now..."
2. **Surface anti-patterns** - "If you see X, that's wrong because Y"
3. **Provide working code** - Scripts that demonstrate correct usage
4. **Include validation** - Pre-flight checks that catch errors early
5. **Know their limits** - "Use this for A, not for B; use Z for B instead"

## When to Use This Skill

### Perfect For:
- 📝 Creating new skills from scratch
- 🔍 Auditing existing skills for quality
- 🛡️ Adding anti-pattern detection
- 📊 Improving progressive disclosure
- 🧠 Encoding domain expertise

### Not For:
- ❌ Generic prompt writing
- ❌ Simple task automation
- ❌ Skills without domain depth

## Core Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Architecture

Skills load in three phases:
- **Phase 1 (~100 tokens)**: Metadata - "Should I activate?"
- **Phase 2 (under 5k tokens)**: Main SKILL.md - "How do I do this?"
- **Phase 3 (as needed)**: Scripts, references - "Show me details"

**Critical**: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Split details into `/references`.

### 2. Description Field Design

The description is your activation trigger. It must include:
- **What**: What capability this provides
- **When**: Specific contexts/keywords for activation
- **Not**: What it's NOT for (prevents false activation)

**Good**:
```yaml
description: Analyzes image embeddings using CLIP alternatives. Use for image-text matching, semantic search. NOT for fine-grained classification, counting, or spatial reasoning.
```

**Bad**:
```yaml
description: Helps with images
```

### 3. Anti-Pattern Detection

Structure for capturing common mistakes:

```markdown
### Pattern: [Name]
**What it looks like**: [Code or description]
**Why it's wrong**: [Fundamental reason]
**What to do instead**: [Better approach]
**How to detect**: [Validation rule]
```

## Skill Structure

### Mandatory Files
```
your-skill/
├── SKILL.md           # Core instructions (under 500 lines)
└── scripts/           # Executable code
    ├── validate.py    # Pre-flight validation
    └── example.py     # Working demonstration
```

### Optional Files
```
├── references/        # Detailed documentation
├── assets/            # Supporting files
└── examples/          # Good/bad examples
```

## Domain-Specific Shibboleths

These are deep knowledge areas where skills add most value:

**CLIP Embeddings**:
- Novice: "CLIP is great for image-text matching"
- Expert: "CLIP fails at counting, fine-grained classification, attribute binding, spatial relationships. Use DCSMs for compositional reasoning."

**React Patterns**:
- Novice: "Use useState for everything"
- Expert: "useState for local UI, useReducer for complex state, Context for prop drilling but NOT for high-frequency updates."

## Validation Checklist

Good skills have:
- [ ] Activation rate: 90%+ when appropriate
- [ ] False positive rate: under 5%
- [ ] Error prevention: Measurable reduction in mistakes
- [ ] Token efficiency: under 5k tokens for typical invocation

## Security Considerations

### Allowed Tools

Only include what you need:
- Read-only skill: `Read,Grep,Glob`
- File creator: `Read,Write,Edit`
- Build tool: `Read,Write,Bash(npm:*,git:*)`

**Never use**: `Bash` without restrictions for untrusted skills

### Audit Checklist
- [ ] Read all scripts before enabling
- [ ] Check for network calls
- [ ] Verify allowed-tools scope
- [ ] Review external dependencies

## Common Questions

### "How much in SKILL.md vs references?"
- **SKILL.md**: Instructions Claude needs every time (under 500 lines)
- **References**: Deep dives Claude references as needed

### "MCP or Script?"
- **Script**: Stateless, no auth, local execution, batch processing
- **MCP**: External API, auth boundaries, stateful connection, real-time data

## Key Insight

Skills are **progressive disclosure machines**. They load incrementally, giving Claude just enough context at each stage. The best skills encode the temporal knowledge and anti-patterns that distinguish experts from novices.
