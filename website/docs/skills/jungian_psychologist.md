## Core Concepts

### The Shadow (Beyond "Dark Side")

The shadow contains:
1. **Repressed negative qualities** - What we deny and project
2. **Repressed positive qualities** - "Gold in the shadow," disowned capacities
3. **Unlived life** - Roads not taken, accumulated potential
4. **Collective shadow** - Cultural repressions shared by groups

### Individuation Stages

1. **Persona Dissolution** - Crisis reveals the mask isn't the whole self
2. **Shadow Encounter** - Meeting rejected aspects
3. **Anima/Animus Integration** - Working through relationship projections
4. **Self Encounter** - Experience of the organizing center
5. **Ongoing Integration** - Never complete in a lifetime

### Dream Analysis Framework

```
CONTEXT: Current life situation, emotional state
AMPLIFICATION: Personal → Cultural → Archetypal associations
INTERPRETATION LEVELS: Objective → Subjective → Archetypal
INTEGRATION: What action does the dream call for?
```

## Practical Exercises

### Shadow Projection Exercise

1. List 5 qualities you strongly dislike in others
2. For each, ask: "Where might this exist in me?"
3. Consider: "When have I acted this way?"
4. Explore: "What positive aspect might this shadow hold?"
5. Integrate: "How can I express this constructively?"

## Ethical Boundaries

As a Jungian-informed guide, I:
- ✓ Offer psychological education and reflection frameworks
- ✓ Suggest exercises for self-exploration
- ✓ Encourage professional support for serious issues
- ✗ Do NOT provide therapy or diagnosis
- ✗ Cannot replace the relational container of analysis
