Strategic job application planning and "Resume SEO" optimization. This skill teaches Claude to approach job applications like a marketing campaign.

## When to Use

Activate when you need to:
- Optimize a resume for a specific job posting
- Determine if a job is worth applying to
- Tailor your resume with the right keywords
- Improve ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scores
- Plan a job search campaign strategy

## Core Philosophy: Resume SEO

Just like websites compete for Google rankings, resumes compete for ATS rankings:

| SEO Concept | Resume Equivalent |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Search query | Job description |
| Web page | Resume |
| Keywords | Skills & requirements |
| Meta description | Professional summary |
| H1 heading | Job title/headline |
| Content quality | Achievement metrics |
| Keyword density | Skills frequency (2-4% optimal) |
| Backlinks | Referrals & endorsements |

## Opportunity Qualification

Before optimizing, the skill determines if a job is worth applying:

### APPLY Signals
- Match score &gt;65% on core requirements
- &lt;3 years experience gap
- Transferable skills cover &gt;50% of gaps
- Company culture aligns (green flags)
- Compensation in range

### SKIP Signals
- Match score &lt;50% with hard blockers
- &gt;5 years experience gap
- Required certifications you don't have
- Multiple red flags (rockstar, wear many hats)

## Tailoring Levels

### LIGHT (Match &gt;80%)
**Time: 15 minutes**
- Reorder skills to match job priority
- Add 2-3 missing keywords to summary
- Ensure job title alignment
- Risk: None

### MEDIUM (Match 60-80%)
**Time: 30 minutes**
- Rewrite summary with top keywords
- Add skills section entries
- Emphasize relevant experience bullets
- Risk: Low

### AGGRESSIVE (Match 50-65%)
**Time: 1 hour**
- Complete summary rewrite
- Restructure skills by relevance
- Modify experience bullets with keywords
- Create variant resume
- Risk: Medium (over-optimization possible)

## ATS Optimization Checklist

### Format
- [ ] Single-column layout
- [ ] Standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Georgia)
- [ ] No tables, columns, text boxes
- [ ] No headers/footers (info gets lost)
- [ ] PDF or DOCX (DOCX preferred for ATS)

### Structure
- [ ] Contact info at top (not in header)
- [ ] Standard section headers
- [ ] Reverse chronological order
- [ ] Consistent date format (Month YYYY)
- [ ] 1-2 pages maximum

### Content
- [ ] Word count 400-800
- [ ] 5+ quantifiable achievements
- [ ] Action verbs at bullet start
- [ ] No buzzwords/clichés
- [ ] Keywords in first 1/3 of resume

### Keywords
- [ ] Keyword density 2-4%
- [ ] Both acronyms AND full forms (AWS/Amazon Web Services)
- [ ] Skills in dedicated section
- [ ] Keywords in summary
- [ ] Exact match for proper nouns

## Tool Integration

Works with the cv-creator-mcp:

```
analyze_job → score_match → suggest_tailoring → score_ats
```

And feeds from career-biographer (CareerProfile) and competitive-cartographer (positioning).

## Example: Alex Chen Workflow

```markdown
## Job: Senior Backend Engineer at TechCorp

### Step 1: Analyze Job
- Required: Go, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, 5+ years
- Preferred: Kafka, gRPC, AWS
- Signals: Remote-friendly ✓, Equity ✓

### Step 2: Score Match
- Overall: 78/100 (GOOD_MATCH)
- Matched: Go, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Kafka, gRPC
- Missing: None critical
- Gap: 0 years (8 &gt; 5 required)

### Step 3: Recommendation
- Apply: YES
- Tailoring Level: LIGHT
- Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Step 4: Tailoring Actions
1. Reorder skills: Go first, then K8s, PostgreSQL
2. Add to summary: "Specialized in event-driven microservices"
3. Ensure "Senior Backend Engineer" exact match in headline

### Step 5: ATS Check
- Score: 85/100 ✓
- Quick wins: Add AWS certification date

### Step 6: Apply
- Resume: alex-chen-techcorp-v1.pdf
- Cover letter: Generated with connection hook
- Tracking: Added to spreadsheet
```

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Applications/week | 20-30 | 25 |
| Response rate | &gt;10% | 16% |
| Interview rate | &gt;5% | 8% |
| Offer rate | &gt;2% | 4% |
| ATS pass rate | &gt;80% | 92% |
| Avg match score | &gt;70% | 78% |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Keyword Stuffing** - &gt;4% density triggers spam filters
2. **Generic Resume** - Same resume for every application
3. **Ignoring ATS** - Pretty resumes that machines can't read
4. **Over-tailoring** - Claims that can't be backed up
5. **Skipping Cover Letter** - Many ATS weight it heavily
