## Complete Example: Database Selection

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-01-15

## Context

We need to select a primary database for the application. The requirements are:
- ACID compliance for transactional integrity
- Support for JSON data alongside relational data
- Horizontal read scalability
- Strong ecosystem and tooling support
- Team familiarity

### Options Considered

1. **PostgreSQL** - Open-source relational database
2. **MySQL** - Open-source relational database
3. **MongoDB** - Document-oriented NoSQL database
4. **CockroachDB** - Distributed SQL database

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database.

## Rationale

### Why PostgreSQL

- **JSONB support**: Native JSON storage with indexing solves our semi-structured data needs without requiring a separate document store
- **Strong consistency**: ACID compliance ensures data integrity for financial transactions
- **Mature ecosystem**: Excellent tooling (pgAdmin, pg_dump, logical replication)
- **Extensions**: PostGIS for geospatial, pg_trgm for fuzzy search, timescaledb for time-series
- **Team experience**: 3 of 4 developers have PostgreSQL production experience
- **Read replicas**: Can scale reads horizontally when needed

### Why Not Others

- **MySQL**: Less capable JSON support, fewer advanced features
- **MongoDB**: Team unfamiliar, eventual consistency concerns for transactions
- **CockroachDB**: Overkill for current scale, higher operational complexity

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single database technology reduces operational overhead
- JSONB eliminates need for separate document store
- Strong hiring pool familiar with PostgreSQL
- Clear upgrade path to managed services (RDS, Cloud SQL)

### Negative

- Must manage schema migrations carefully
- Write scaling limited to vertical scaling initially
- Need to monitor connection pooling (pgBouncer may be needed)

### Risks

- **Data growth**: If data exceeds single-node capacity, will need sharding strategy
- **Mitigation**: Monitor growth, plan sharding evaluation at 500GB

## Related Decisions

- ADR-002: Connection pooling strategy
- ADR-003: Backup and recovery procedures

## ADR Best Practices

### Naming Convention
- `ADR-001-use-postgresql-for-database.md`
- Numbered, lowercase, hyphen-separated

### When to Write an ADR
- Significant architectural decisions
- Technology selections
- Design pattern choices
- Security-critical decisions
- Anything someone might question later

### When NOT to Write an ADR
- Obvious choices with no alternatives
- Purely implementation details
- Temporary decisions during prototyping

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Proposed** - Under discussion
2. **Accepted** - Decision made, in effect
3. **Deprecated** - No longer recommended but still exists
4. **Superseded** - Replaced by newer decision
