## Key Strategies

### Freemium SaaS Model

The 80/20 rule: 80% stay free, but the free tier demonstrates enough value to convert 20%.

**Good to gate:**
- Usage volume (API calls, storage, exports)
- Team collaboration features
- White-labeling/custom branding
- Priority support

**Bad to gate:**
- Core functionality
- Basic features competitors offer free
- Security features (never gate security)

### Sponsorship Pricing Formula

```
Monthly visitors × $0.01-0.05 = Base sponsorship rate

Example:
50,000 monthly visitors × $0.02 = $1,000/month potential
```

### Email List Building

The foundation of all monetization. Lead magnets for developers:
- Cheatsheets/quick reference guides
- Starter templates/boilerplates
- Exclusive tutorials/deep dives
- Early access to new features

## When to Use

**Use for:**
- Choosing monetization models for dev tools
- Setting up freemium/premium tiers
- Pricing strategy decisions
- Email list building for launches
- Sponsorship and donation systems
- Passive income optimization

**NOT for:**
- Enterprise B2B sales processes
- VC fundraising/pitch decks
- Large-scale advertising campaigns
- Affiliate marketing schemes

## Revenue Benchmarks (Indie Scale)

| Stage | Monthly Revenue | What it means |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Ramen Profitable | $2-5k | Can quit day job (barely) |
| Comfortable | $10-20k | Good indie income |
| Scaling | $50k+ | Time to consider hiring |

**Reality check**: Most indie projects earn $0-500/month. Getting to $2k/month puts you in the top 10% of indie hackers.

## The Patient Path (Cory Zue's Framework)

1. Start consulting → Validates skills, builds runway
2. Build small products → $100-1k/month each
3. Stack revenue streams → Multiple small wins
4. Find the winner → One product takes off
5. Double down → Focus on what works
