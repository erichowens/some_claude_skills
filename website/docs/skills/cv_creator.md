## Overview

The **CV Creator** is a specialized AI skill that transforms structured career data and competitive positioning insights into ATS-optimized, professionally formatted resumes. It bridges the gap between rich career narratives (from career-biographer) and strategic positioning (from competitive-cartographer) to produce resumes that pass both automated screening systems and human review.

### Key Features

- **ATS Optimization**: Generates resumes scoring 85+ on ATS compatibility
- **Multi-Format Output**: PDF, DOCX, LaTeX, JSON Resume, HTML, Markdown
- **Strategic Positioning**: Incorporates competitive differentiation insights
- **Role-Specific Tailoring**: Creates optimized variants for different targets
- **2025 Best Practices**: Follows latest resume trends (skills-based, metrics-driven)

### Integration Power

Works seamlessly with:
- **career-biographer**: Structured career data collection
- **competitive-cartographer**: Strategic market positioning

## Quick Start

### Basic Resume Generation

```markdown
User: "Create a resume for senior software engineer roles"

CV Creator:
1. Requests CareerProfile (from biographer or direct input)
2. Requests PositioningStrategy (from cartographer or optional)
3. Requests target role/company (optional for optimization)
4. Generates resume with clean ATS-compatible formatting
5. Calculates ATS score and provides recommendations
6. Exports in requested formats (PDF, DOCX, JSON Resume)
```

### Three-Skill Orchestrated Workflow

```markdown
User: "I need a resume for FAANG senior backend engineer roles"

Step 1: career-biographer
→ Conducts empathetic interview
→ Extracts structured CareerProfile
→ Documents achievements, skills, timeline

Step 2: competitive-cartographer
→ Maps FAANG senior backend landscape
→ Identifies white space and differentiators
→ Generates PositioningStrategy

Step 3: cv-creator
→ Combines CareerProfile + PositioningStrategy
→ Generates ATS-optimized resume
→ Tailors for FAANG technical expectations

Deliverables:

## Resume Content Best Practices

### Professional Summary

**Formula:**
```
[Seniority Level] + [Technical Focus] with [Years] years building [Domain].
[Key Achievement with Metric]. Expertise in [Top 3-5 Skills].
[Current Goal or Target Role].
```

**Example:**
```
Senior Backend Engineer with 8 years building scalable distributed systems.
Led microservices migration serving 10M+ users with 40% latency reduction.
Expertise in Go, Kubernetes, gRPC, and cloud-native architecture.
Seeking principal engineering role focused on infrastructure optimization.
```

### Work Experience Bullets

**Formula:**
```
[Action Verb] + [What you did] + [How/Why] + [Quantifiable Result]
```

**Examples:**
- ✓ Led microservices migration from monolith, reducing API latency by 40% and improving deployment frequency to daily releases
- ✓ Architected event-driven system handling 10M+ DAU using Kubernetes, Go, and gRPC with 99.99% uptime
- ✓ Mentored team of 5 engineers through code reviews, resulting in 50% faster onboarding and 3 promotions

### Core Skills Section

Prioritize 15-20 specific technical skills:

```
Go, Kubernetes, Docker, gRPC, PostgreSQL, Redis, Microservices,
Distributed Systems, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, System Design,
API Design, Performance Optimization, Monitoring & Observability
```

**Criteria:**
1. Mentioned in job description
2. Highest proficiency level
3. Most years of experience
4. Relevant to target role

## Common Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Creative Resume for Tech Roles
**Problem:** Colorful infographics, skill bars, two-column layout
**Why it's wrong:** ATS can't parse graphics or complex layouts
**Solution:** Use Modern Minimalist template with clean text format

### ❌ Generic Objective Statement
**Problem:** "Seeking a challenging role in a growth-oriented company..."
**Why it's wrong:** Wastes space, provides no value
**Solution:** Use professional summary with specific metrics

### ❌ Listing Every Technology Ever Used
**Problem:** 40+ skills including outdated technologies
**Why it's wrong:** Dilutes expertise, unclear proficiency
**Solution:** List 15-20 most relevant skills for target role

### ❌ Responsibilities Without Outcomes
**Problem:** "Managed a team", "Worked on backend systems"
**Why it's wrong:** Doesn't show impact or value
**Solution:** "Led team of 5 engineers to deliver microservices migration, reducing deployment time by 70%"

## Success Metrics

Well-generated resumes achieve:
- **ATS Score**: 85+ out of 100
- **Keyword Coverage**: 80%+ for job-specific variants
- **Length**: 1-2 pages (strict limit)
- **Parsing Errors**: 0 in ATS simulation
- **Readability**: &lt;30 second recruiter scan time

## When to Use

✅ **Use cv-creator when:**
- Creating resume from career-biographer data
- Optimizing for specific job posting
- Generating multiple resume variants
- Need ATS score and recommendations
- Require multi-format export

❌ **Do NOT use when:**
- Writing cover letters
- Creating portfolio websites
- LinkedIn profile optimization
- Interview preparation
- Career counseling

## Integration Points

### From Career Biographer

```typescript
interface CareerProfile {
  name: string;
  headline: string;
  summary: string;
  timelineEvents: Array<{
    date: string;
    type: string;
    title: string;
    impact: string;
  }>;
  skills: Array<{
    name: string;
    proficiency: number;
    yearsOfExperience: number;
  }>;
}
```

### From Competitive Cartographer

```typescript
interface PositioningStrategy {
  positioning: {
    headline: string;
    differentiators: string[];
  };
  contentStrategy: {
    tone: string;
    depth: string;
  };
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Low ATS Score (<70)
**Causes:** Complex formatting, graphics, non-standard fonts
**Fix:** Switch to Minimalist template, remove all graphics, use standard headers

### Low Keyword Coverage (<60%)
**Causes:** Not tailoring to job description, different terminology
**Fix:** Extract keywords from posting, add to Core Skills, use exact job description language

### Resume >2 Pages
**Causes:** Including every role, too many bullets, verbose
**Fix:** Consolidate older roles, limit bullets (7-10 recent, 3-5 older), trim to 1-2 lines each

### Generic Professional Summary
**Causes:** Template language, no specific achievements
**Fix:** Include specific metric, name exact technologies, state clear career goal
