# Attachment Styles in Relationships

## Overview

Attachment theory explains how early relationships with caregivers shape our adult relationship patterns. Understanding your style and your partner's can transform communication.

## The Four Attachment Styles

### Secure Attachment (~50% of population)

```
SECURE ATTACHMENT
─────────────────

CORE BELIEF:
"I am worthy of love. Others are reliable."

HOW THEY SHOW UP IN RELATIONSHIPS:

├── Can handle delayed responses
├── Direct about needs and feelings
├── Doesn't play games or test partner
└── Comfortable with both initiating and receiving

TEXTS YOU MIGHT RECEIVE:
"Hey, I noticed you seemed quiet tonight. Everything okay?
No pressure if you don't want to talk, just checking in."

"I'm feeling a little neglected lately. Can we plan
some quality time this weekend?"

"That bothered me earlier. Can we talk about it when
you get home?"
```

### Anxious Attachment (~20% of population)

```

Did you mean it? I need to know."

WHAT THEY NEED:

```

## Attachment Style Interactions

### The Anxious-Avoidant Trap

```
THE MOST COMMON DIFFICULT PAIRING
─────────────────────────────────

Anxious person:
├── Seeks closeness, reassurance
├── Partner's distance triggers panic
├── Pursues more intensely
└── "Why won't they respond?!"

Avoidant person:
├── Needs space, independence
├── Partner's pursuit feels suffocating
├── Withdraws more
└── "Why are they so needy?!"

THE CYCLE:
        Anxious pursues
              ↓
        Avoidant withdraws
              ↓
        Anxious pursues MORE
              ↓
        Avoidant withdraws MORE
              ↓
        (repeat until explosion)

BREAKING THE CYCLE:

For the Anxious partner:
├── Name your trigger: "I'm feeling anxious because..."
├── Self-soothe before texting
├── Ask for what you need clearly, once
├── Give them space to respond
├── Don't chase—it makes it worse
└── Build self-worth outside the relationship

For the Avoidant partner:
├── Name your trigger: "I'm feeling overwhelmed..."
├── Communicate when you need space
├── Offer a specific return time
├── Small reassurances go far
├── Understand pursuit = they care
└── Practice tolerating closeness
```

### Communication Adjustments by Style

```
TEXTING AN ANXIOUS PARTNER
──────────────────────────
DO:
├── Respond in reasonable timeframe
├── If busy, quick "thinking of you, busy now"
├── Affirm the relationship regularly
├── Be specific about plans/times
├── Reassure without being asked sometimes
└── "I love you" goes a long way

DON'T:
├── Leave them hanging for hours unexplained
├── Be vague about plans
├── Dismiss their feelings as "overreacting"
├── Play hard to get
└── Go quiet during conflict

TEXTING AN AVOIDANT PARTNER
───────────────────────────
DO:
├── Give space between messages
├── Keep texts concise
├── Respect their response time
├── Accept short responses without hurt
├── Have your own life/interests
└── Light invitation > heavy demand

DON'T:
├── Send multiple texts if no response
├── Demand immediate emotional processing
├── Corner them via text about issues
├── Interpret silence as rejection
├── Make them feel guilty for needing space
└── Chase when they withdraw
```
