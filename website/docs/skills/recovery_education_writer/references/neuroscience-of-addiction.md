# Neuroscience of Addiction: Core Concepts

This document provides the foundational neuroscience concepts for writing recovery education content.

## The Brain's Reward System

### Normal Function
The brain's reward system evolved to keep you alive by reinforcing survival behaviors:
- Eating → dopamine release → "do that again"
- Social bonding → dopamine release → "seek connection"
- Sex → dopamine release → "reproduce"

**Key structures:**
- **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)**: Dopamine production center
- **Nucleus Accumbens (NAc)**: Reward processing hub
- **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)**: Decision-making, impulse control
- **Amygdala**: Emotional memory, fear/pleasure associations

### What Drugs Do
Drugs hijack this system by:
1. Creating artificially high dopamine levels (up to 1200% for meth vs. 200% for food)
2. Teaching the brain "this is more important than food/sex/connection"
3. Weakening the prefrontal cortex's ability to say "no"
4. Strengthening amygdala memories associated with using

**Result:** The drug becomes the most salient (important) thing in your world.

## Dopamine: Not Just Pleasure

**Common myth:** Dopamine = pleasure

**Reality:** Dopamine = motivation, salience, anticipation

### What Dopamine Actually Does:
1. **Motivation:** "This is important—pursue it"
2. **Salience:** "Pay attention to this"
3. **Learning:** "Remember how you got this reward"
4. **Anticipation:** "The reward is coming—get ready"

### In Addiction:
- Dopamine anticipation → cravings (the wanting, not the liking)
- Dopamine salience → cues become triggers (people, places, times of day)
- Dopamine learning → superhighways to using behavior

### In Recovery:
- Dopamine receptors downregulated → anhedonia (nothing feels good)
- Natural rewards can't compete → emotional flatness
- Takes months for receptors to upregulate → the 6-week wall

---

## The Salience Network

### What It Is:
The brain's pattern-detection system that decides what's important.

**Structures involved:**
- Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
- Insula
- Amygdala

### Normal Function:
- Detects threats (rustling in bushes → potential predator → pay attention)
- Identifies rewards (smell of food → hunger satisfied → approach)
- Filters out irrelevant stimuli (background noise → ignore)

### In Stimulant Use (Especially Meth):
- Dopamine flood → salience network overactivation
- Pattern detector goes haywire → sees threats everywhere
- Shadow → THREAT. Click in wall → RECORDING DEVICE. Neighbor → WATCHING YOU.

**This is why meth causes paranoia.** It's not psychological—it's neurological pattern detection on overdrive.

### In Recovery:
- Salience network recalibrates over 2-4 weeks
- Paranoia fades as dopamine normalizes
- If persists >30 days → may need antipsychotic support

## GABA and Glutamate: The Brake and Gas

### GABA (The Brake):
- Inhibitory neurotransmitter
- Calms neural activity
- Promotes sleep, relaxation, anxiety reduction

**Substances that enhance GABA:**
- Alcohol
- Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium)
- GHB

### Glutamate (The Gas):
- Excitatory neurotransmitter
- Activates neural circuits
- Promotes alertness, learning, anxiety

**Substances that suppress glutamate:**
- Alcohol
- Benzos

### What Happens in Addiction:
**Alcohol/benzo use:**
1. GABA artificially enhanced → brain downregulates GABA receptors
2. Glutamate suppressed → brain upregulates glutamate production

**When you stop using:**
1. GABA receptors still downregulated → no natural brake
2. Glutamate production upregulated → gas pedal stuck

**Result:**
- Anxiety, panic attacks
- Insomnia
- Seizures (in severe cases)
- Hyperarousal

**Timeline:**
- Acute: 3-7 days (most dangerous for seizures)
- PAWS: 2-12 weeks (anxiety, insomnia persist)
- Full GABA/glutamate rebalancing: 3-6 months

---

## Neuroplasticity: The Brain's Ability to Heal

### What It Is:
The brain's ability to reorganize neural pathways based on experience.

**Key principle:** Neurons that fire together, wire together.

### In Addiction:
- Using → dopamine → reinforcement → neural superhighway
- Every time you use, the pathway strengthens
- After months/years, the pathway is a six-lane freeway

### In Recovery:
- Every day sober, the pathway weakens slightly
- New pathways form (sober coping skills)
- Old pathways prune (use less, think about it less)

**Timeline:**
- Acute changes: Weeks 1-4 (most dramatic)
- Continued restructuring: Months 2-12
- Long-term plasticity: 12-24 months

**What supports neuroplasticity:**
- Sleep (brain prunes unused pathways during sleep)
- Exercise (increases BDNF—brain fertilizer)
- Learning new skills (activates neurogenesis)
- Social connection (activates reward pathways)
- Therapy (cognitive restructuring)

## Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS)

### What It Is:
A constellation of symptoms that persist weeks to months after acute withdrawal.

**Common PAWS symptoms:**
- Anhedonia (nothing feels good)
- Emotional flatness or mood swings
- Insomnia or hypersomnia
- Cognitive fog (memory, attention issues)
- Anxiety/irritability
- Cravings

### Why It Happens:
The brain is healing, but healing is slow:
- Dopamine receptors upregulating
- GABA/glutamate rebalancing
- Serotonin system recalibrating
- Neural pathways pruning and rewiring

### Timeline (Varies by Substance):
**Stimulants (meth, cocaine):**
- PAWS peaks: Weeks 4-12
- Duration: 3-6 months (sometimes up to 2 years)

**Opioids (heroin, fentanyl, pills):**
- PAWS peaks: Weeks 2-8
- Duration: 6-24 months

**Alcohol/Benzos:**
- PAWS peaks: Weeks 2-4
- Duration: 6-18 months

**Cannabis:**
- PAWS peaks: Weeks 2-6
- Duration: 1-3 months

### Why This Matters:
- The 6-week wall is real and predictable
- It's not a sign you're failing—it's a sign your brain is healing
- Knowing the timeline helps you weather it

## Cue-Induced Craving (Classical Conditioning)

### The Mechanism:
1. **Using:** Drug → dopamine → reward
2. **Learning:** Brain associates cues with the reward
   - Person you used with → trigger
   - Time of day → trigger
   - Emotion (stress, loneliness) → trigger
   - Place → trigger
3. **Conditioning:** Cue alone → dopamine anticipation → craving

**This is Pavlov's dogs, but for addiction.**
- Bell → salivation (dogs)
- Cue → craving (humans)

### Why Cravings Feel Physical:
- The cue triggers dopamine anticipation
- Your brain expects the reward
- When the reward doesn't come → physical discomfort (restlessness, agitation)
- This is automatic—not a character flaw

### In Recovery:
- Cues lose power over time (extinction)
- But extinction is slow—requires repeated exposure to cue WITHOUT reward
- Avoidance (staying away from triggers) delays extinction
- Gradual exposure (with support) speeds it

**Timeline:**
- Cravings most intense: Weeks 1-8
- Decrease significantly: Months 3-6
- Occasional resurgence: Years into recovery (stress, anniversaries)

## Sleep Architecture and Recovery

### Normal Sleep:
- **Stage 1-2:** Light sleep (50% of night)
- **Stage 3:** Deep sleep (20% of night) → physical restoration
- **REM:** Dream sleep (25% of night) → emotional processing, memory consolidation

### What Drugs Do:
**Stimulants (meth, cocaine):**
- Suppress REM sleep
- Even if you sleep while using, you're not getting restorative REM

**Alcohol/Benzos:**
- Suppress REM and deep sleep
- Create "drunk sleep" (unconsciousness, not rest)

**Opioids:**
- Suppress REM sleep
- Disrupt sleep architecture

**Cannabis:**
- Suppresses REM sleep
- Creates sleep debt

### In Early Recovery:
**REM Rebound:**
- Your brain tries to catch up on months/years of REM debt
- Result: Intense, vivid dreams (often about using)
- This is healing, not a sign of relapse desire

**Insomnia:**
- Circadian rhythm disrupted
- GABA/glutamate imbalance
- Anxiety

**Timeline:**
- Acute insomnia: Weeks 1-4
- Gradual improvement: Months 2-3
- Full sleep restoration: 3-6 months

## Emotional Regulation Systems

### The Emotional Brain:
**Amygdala:** Emotional intensity (fear, pleasure)
**Prefrontal Cortex:** Emotional regulation (impulse control, rational thought)
**Hippocampus:** Emotional memory

### In Addiction:
- Amygdala hyperactive (high emotional reactivity)
- PFC weakened (poor impulse control)
- Hippocampus encodes using memories strongly

**Result:** Emotional dysregulation—big feelings, poor coping.

### In Recovery:
**Weeks 1-8:**
- Emotional rollercoaster (amygdala still hyperactive)
- Or emotional flatness (dopamine-depleted)

**Months 2-6:**
- PFC starts strengthening (better impulse control)
- Amygdala calms down (less reactive)

**Months 6-12:**
- Emotional range returns
- Better able to tolerate distress
- Hippocampus can encode new, sober memories

## Key Takeaways for Writing

1. **Addiction is neurological, not moral.**
   - Dopamine hijacks survival circuits.
   - Willpower alone can't override biology.

2. **Recovery is biological healing.**
   - Takes time (months to years).
   - Follows predictable timelines.
   - Neuroplasticity is real.

3. **Symptoms are predictable.**
   - Anhedonia, cravings, insomnia, paranoia—all have neurological explanations.
   - Knowing the mechanism reduces shame.

4. **The brain can heal.**
   - Dopamine receptors upregulate.
   - GABA/glutamate rebalance.
   - Neural pathways prune and rewire.
   - Timelines are slower than anyone wants, but healing happens.
