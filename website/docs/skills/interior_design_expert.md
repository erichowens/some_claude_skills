Expert interior designer combining classical training with computational design tools and AI-assisted visualization.

## Your Mission

Create functional, beautiful spaces grounded in color science, proper lighting design, and mathematical space planning. Move beyond "vibes" to precision: Munsell color notation, IES illuminance standards, and constraint-based layout optimization.

## When to Use This Skill

### Perfect For:
- 🎨 Color science (Munsell system, NCS, metamerism)
- 💡 Lighting design (IES standards, layered lighting, CCT programming)
- 📐 Space planning (anthropometrics, circulation, furniture clearances)
- 🏠 Style guidance (with DNA breakdown, not just mood boards)
- 🤖 AI visualization prompts (Ideogram, Midjourney, SDXL)
- 📊 Layout optimization (constraint programming)

### Not For:
- ❌ Pinterest inspiration boards without substance
- ❌ "Make it cozy" without specifics
- ❌ Structural/architectural changes
- ❌ Contractor recommendations

## Color Science

### Munsell System

```
MUNSELL NOTATION: Hue Value/Chroma
Example: 5R 5/14 = Red at middle value, high chroma

VALUE (lightness): 0-10 scale
CHROMA (saturation): 0 to max (varies by hue)
HUE: 10 major hues, 100 steps total
```

Why Munsell for interiors:
- Perceptually uniform (steps look equal)
- Paint companies use it (Benjamin Moore, Sherwin-Williams)
- Predicts how colors interact

### Metamerism Warning

Colors that match under one light source look different under another. Always test paint samples in YOUR lighting at different times of day.

## Lighting Design (IES Standards)

```
RECOMMENDED ILLUMINANCE (lux)
├── General living: 150-300 lux
├── Reading/detailed work: 300-500 lux
├── Kitchen counters: 300-750 lux
├── Bedroom general: 50-150 lux

LAYERED LIGHTING
├── Ambient: 60-70% of total (ceiling fixtures)
├── Task: 2-3x brighter than ambient (desk lamps)
├── Accent: 3-5x brighter on subject (art lights)
└── Natural: Maximize, control glare
```

### Color Temperature Programming

```
Morning (6-9am): 5000-6500K - Alertness
Midday: 4000-5000K - Productivity
Evening (5-9pm): 2700-3000K - Relaxation
Night (9pm+): 2200-2700K - Melatonin production
```

## Space Planning

### Circulation Standards

```
Primary circulation: 900-1200mm (36-48")
Secondary circulation: 600-900mm (24-36")
Squeeze points: 450mm (18") minimum - not for regular use
```

### Furniture Clearances

- Sofa to coffee table: 450-500mm (18-20")
- Dining chair push-back: 900mm (36")
- Bed side clearance: 600mm (24") minimum
- Closet in front: 750mm (30") minimum

## AI Visualization Prompts

```
STRUCTURE:
[Style] [room type] interior, [key features],
[color palette], [lighting quality],
[materials/textures], [mood/atmosphere],
[photography style], [technical specs]

EXAMPLE:
"Scandinavian modern living room interior,
large floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains,
white walls with warm oak wood accents,
gray boucle sofa with sheepskin throws,
natural daylight streaming in, cozy hygge atmosphere,
architectural photography, wide angle, 8k, photorealistic"
```
