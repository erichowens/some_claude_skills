# Common Challenges & Mindset

## Challenge 1: "I Don't Know What to Build"

**Big Tech Mindset:** "We need user research, market analysis, competitive landscape..."

**Indie Reality:**
```
Build something YOU need.
Ex-FAANG engineers have problems worth solving:
- Tools for managing ADHD productivity
- ML workflow automation
- Code review assistants
- Time tracking for consultants
- Portfolio/resume builders for tech
- Interview prep platforms

You are the target audience.
Build for yourself, charge others like you.
```

## Challenge 2: "I Can't Do Marketing/Sales"

**Big Tech Mindset:** "We have marketing teams for this"

**Indie Reality:**
```
You don't need to "do marketing."
You need to have conversations.

Script:
"I built [thing] because I had [problem].
 Does this resonate with you?"

If yes: "Want to try it?"
If no: "What would make it useful?"

That's it. Repeat 100 times.
```

**ADHD Hack:**
Frame it as "user research" not "sales"
- Your brain likes solving problems (research)
- Your brain hates "selling" (feels icky)
→ Reframe and it becomes doable

## Challenge 3: "I Keep Starting New Projects"

**This is the #1 ADHD killer of indie success.**

**The Rule:** ONE project in "launch" phase at a time.

**Allowed:**
- ✅ Maintain existing profitable app
- ✅ Work on ONE new app
- ✅ Take notes on future ideas

**Not allowed:**
- ❌ Work on multiple pre-launch projects
- ❌ Rebuild existing app from scratch
- ❌ Start "just a quick experiment" (lies)

**Use "Idea Backlog" (Notion):**
- When new idea hits: Write it down
- Set reminder: Review in 1 month
- Most ideas won't survive 30 days
- The ones that do = worth building

## Challenge 4: "I'm Running Out of Money"

**Runway Planning (Critical)**

Calculate:
- Monthly expenses: $X
- Current savings: $Y
- Runway: Y / X months

**If runway \< 6 months:**
URGENT: Get to first dollar FAST
- Simplify MVP (1 week to launch)
- Freelance 2 days/week ($200-300/hour ML consulting)
- Live on minimal expenses

**If runway 6-12 months:**
FOCUSED: Execute the plan
- 2-week MVP
- 1 month to $1K MRR
- 3 months to $5K MRR

**If runway > 12 months:**
STRATEGIC: Take time to validate
- Test multiple ideas
- Build audience first
- Choose best opportunity

**Don't let runway hit zero.**
At 3 months remaining: Get freelance income or pivot.

## Challenge 5: "Impostor Syndrome"

**Big Tech Mindset:** "I'm just a Google engineer, why would anyone buy from me?"

**Reality Check - You have MASSIVE advantages:**

1. **Technical Depth**
   Most indie hackers can't build what you can.
   Your "basic" = someone else's "impossible"

2. **Big Tech Credential**
   "Ex-Google ML Engineer" = instant credibility
   Use it in bio, landing page, marketing

3. **Problem-Solving**
   You debugged distributed systems at scale.
   A small business problem? Easy mode.

4. **AI Native**
   You understand LLMs better than 99% of people.
   This is unfair advantage in 2024+

Your impostor syndrome is lying.
You're more qualified than you think.

## ADHD + Entrepreneurship: Honest Assessment

### What Makes It Harder
- ❌ No external structure (meetings, deadlines)
- ❌ No team to catch your mistakes
- ❌ Decision fatigue (you decide EVERYTHING)
- ❌ Inconsistent income (ADHD hates uncertainty)
- ❌ Easy to doom-scroll instead of work
- ❌ Rejection sensitivity (product criticism hurts)

### What Makes It Easier
- ✅ Work when hyperfocus strikes (2am? Fine!)
- ✅ No boring meetings
- ✅ Only work on interesting problems
- ✅ Direct feedback (revenue = validation)
- ✅ Dopamine from shipping + earning
- ✅ Control your environment completely

### The Honest Assessment

```
Entrepreneurship is NOT for everyone with ADHD.

You'll thrive if:
✓ You have high frustration tolerance
✓ You can handle rejection
✓ You're okay with uncertainty
✓ You have support system (partner, friends)
✓ You're willing to do boring tasks sometimes
✓ You can recognize when to quit

You'll struggle if:
✗ You need external validation constantly
✗ You can't handle financial stress
✗ You abandon projects at first obstacle
✗ You won't do any marketing/sales
✗ You need immediate results (patience required)

Be honest with yourself.
There's no shame in going back to W2.
```

## Emergency Protocols

### When You're Stuck (The 3-Day Rule)

**Day 1:** Acknowledge you're stuck. Don't shame yourself.

**Day 2:** Talk to someone
- DM another indie hacker
- Post in community: "I'm stuck on X. Help?"

**Day 3:** Change something
- New location (coffee shop)
- Different task (skip to easier thing)
- Ask for help (hire contractor for $100 to unblock)

**If still stuck after 3 days:**
→ The scope is too big. Cut features.
→ Or the idea isn't exciting anymore. Okay to pivot.

### When You Want to Quit

Before quitting, ask:

1. **Is this a bad idea or am I just tired?**
   (If tired: Take a week off. Revisit after.)

2. **Have I given it a fair shot?**
   (Fair shot = 3 months of consistent effort)

3. **Is there any traction?**
   (Even 5 happy users = signal)

4. **What would I do instead?**
   (If answer is "go back to FAANG": Maybe take a break first)

It's okay to quit. Sunk cost fallacy is real.
But make sure you're quitting the right thing for the right reasons.
