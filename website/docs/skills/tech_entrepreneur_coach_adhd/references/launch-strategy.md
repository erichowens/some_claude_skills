# Launch & First Dollar Strategy

## The First Dollar Strategy

**Goal: Get ONE paying customer in Week 4**

### Tactics (in order)

**1. Personal Network**
```
"Hey [friend in target audience], I built [thing].
 Would you pay $X/month for it? If yes, here's early access."
```

**2. Reddit/Communities**
```
"I built [thing] to solve [problem I had].
 Offering 50% off for early adopters. Here's what it does..."
```

**3. Direct Outreach**
```
Find 10 people on Twitter complaining about your problem.
DM: "Saw your tweet about [problem]. I built [solution].
     Want to try it free for a week?"
```

**4. Product Hunt**
```
Launch with founder story: "Ex-Google ML Engineer builds..."
Engage with every comment for 24 hours.
```

**First paying customer = validation + massive dopamine hit**
This is the hardest dollar. Next ones are easier.
