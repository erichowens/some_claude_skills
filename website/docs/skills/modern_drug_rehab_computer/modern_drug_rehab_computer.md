## Coping Skills Toolkit

### Immediate Craving Response (HALT + STOP)

```
When craving hits, check HALT:
├── H - Hungry? (eat something nutritious)
├── A - Angry? (process the emotion)
├── L - Lonely? (reach out to someone)
└── T - Tired? (rest if possible)

Then STOP:
├── S - Stop what you're doing
├── T - Take a breath
├── O - Observe what you're feeling
└── P - Proceed mindfully
```

### Grounding Techniques (5-4-3-2-1)

```
For anxiety, dissociation, or overwhelming cravings:

5 things you can SEE
├── Look around, name them out loud

4 things you can TOUCH
├── Feel textures, temperatures

3 things you can HEAR
├── Ambient sounds, near and far

2 things you can SMELL
├── Notice scents in your environment

1 thing you can TASTE
├── Focus on current taste in your mouth
```

### DBT Distress Tolerance (TIP Skills)

```
For high-intensity emotional moments:

T - Temperature
├── Hold ice cubes, cold water on face
├── Activates dive reflex, calms nervous system

I - Intense Exercise
├── Run in place, jumping jacks, stairs
├── Burns off stress hormones

P - Paced Breathing
├── Breathe out longer than in (4-7-8 pattern)
├── Activates parasympathetic system

P - Progressive Muscle Relaxation
├── Tense and release muscle groups
├── Releases physical tension
```

### Urge Surfing

```
Instead of fighting the craving, ride it like a wave:

1. Notice the urge (don't judge it)
2. Rate its intensity (1-10)
3. Observe where you feel it in your body
4. Breathe into that area
5. Watch the intensity rise...
6. ...peak...
7. ...and fall (cravings typically last 15-30 minutes)
8. Rate the intensity again

Key insight: Cravings are temporary. You don't have to act on them.
```

## Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)

### Understanding Your MAT Options

| Medication | Used For | How It Works | Key Considerations |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Suboxone** (buprenorphine/naloxone) | Opioid use | Partial agonist, blocks cravings | Must be in withdrawal to start |
| **Sublocade** | Opioid use | Monthly injection of buprenorphine | Steady levels, no daily dosing |
| **Methadone** | Opioid use | Full agonist, daily dosing | Clinic visits required |
| **Vivitrol** | Opioid/alcohol | Blocks receptors, monthly injection | Must be opioid-free 7-14 days |
| **Naltrexone** (oral) | Opioid/alcohol | Blocks receptors, daily pill | Reduces "high" from use |
| **Antabuse** | Alcohol | Creates nausea if drinking | Deterrent effect |
| **Campral** | Alcohol | Balances brain chemistry | Reduces cravings |

### MAT Myths vs. Facts

```
MYTH: "MAT is just trading one drug for another"
FACT: MAT is evidence-based medicine that normalizes brain function,
      reduces cravings, and saves lives. It's no different than using
      insulin for diabetes.

MYTH: "You're not really sober if you're on MAT"
FACT: Recovery is not defined by the absence of medication.
      Stability, function, and quality of life are what matter.

MYTH: "You should get off MAT as soon as possible"
FACT: Research shows longer MAT duration = better outcomes.
      The decision to taper should be made with your doctor when stable.
```

## Living Situation Considerations

### Residential Treatment

```
Making the Most of Residential:
├── Engage fully in programming
├── Build relationships with peers and staff
├── Follow the structure (it's there for a reason)
├── Be honest in groups and with your counselor
├── Use free time productively
├── Start planning for aftercare early
└── Practice skills in a safe environment
```

### IOP/PHP (Outpatient - Living at Home)

```
Commuting to Treatment Challenges:
├── Returning home to triggers daily
├── Managing home responsibilities + treatment
├── Partners/family who don't understand
├── Work/childcare conflicts
├── Isolation between sessions
└── Access to substances

Strategies:
├── Secure your home environment (remove substances)
├── Communicate with family about boundaries
├── Build structure into non-treatment hours
├── Attend extra meetings on non-treatment days
├── Keep your counselor informed of home challenges
├── Have phone numbers ready for crisis moments
└── Consider sober living if home isn't safe
```

## Family & Relationship Dynamics

### Communicating with Partners/Family

```
What families need to understand:
├── Addiction is a brain disease, not a moral failing
├── Recovery is a process, not an event
├── Their role: support, not control
├── Boundaries are healthy for everyone
├── Al-Anon/Nar-Anon exists for them too

What you can communicate:
├── "I'm in treatment and taking this seriously"
├── "This is what I need from you right now: [specific request]"
├── "I understand I've hurt you. I'm working on making amends"
├── "Recovery is my responsibility. I need your support, not your management"
├── "Let's work on this together with a family counselor"
```

### Couples Therapy in Recovery

```
Why couples therapy matters:
├── Addiction affects the whole relationship
├── Communication patterns need rebuilding
├── Trust takes time and structured work
├── Both partners have healing to do
├── Codependency patterns need addressing

When to start:
├── Usually after initial stabilization (30-90 days)
├── When both partners are willing
├── With a therapist who understands addiction
├── As complement to individual work, not replacement
```

## Holistic Wellness

### Daily Recovery Structure

```
Morning Routine:
├── Gratitude list (3 things)
├── Meditation/prayer (5-15 min)
├── Healthy breakfast
├── Review daily intentions
└── Morning meeting (if helpful)

Throughout Day:
├── Regular check-ins with self
├── Meals at consistent times
├── Movement/exercise
├── Connection with recovery support
└── Practice skills from treatment

Evening Routine:
├── Review the day (what went well?)
├── 10th step inventory (if in 12-step)
├── Prepare for tomorrow
├── Wind-down activities (no screens)
└── Consistent bedtime
```

### Nutrition & Sleep

```
Nutrition in Recovery:
├── Regular meals stabilize blood sugar and mood
├── Protein helps rebuild neurotransmitters
├── Reduce sugar/caffeine (can trigger cravings)
├── Stay hydrated
└── Consider consulting nutritionist

Sleep Hygiene:
├── Consistent sleep/wake times
├── No screens 1 hour before bed
├── Cool, dark room
├── Limit caffeine after noon
├── Address sleep issues with your doctor
└── Many in recovery have disrupted sleep initially - it improves
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### "I feel like I don't fit in at meetings"

```
Options:
├── Try different meetings (they vary widely)
├── Try different programs (SMART, Refuge, LifeRing)
├── Look for specialized meetings (LGBTQ+, young people, professionals)
├── Online meetings offer more variety
├── Focus on similarities, not differences
└── Give it time - connection builds gradually
```

### "My family doesn't trust me"

```
Understanding:
├── Trust is rebuilt through consistent action over time
├── It's not about proving yourself - it's about being yourself
├── Their caution is protective, not punishing
├── Focus on what you CAN control (your behavior)

Actions:
├── Be where you say you'll be
├── Follow through on commitments
├── Accept accountability without defensiveness
├── Let time and consistency work
└── Consider family therapy when appropriate
```

### "I'm bored without substances"

```
The Science:
├── Dopamine system is recalibrating
├── Things will feel less pleasurable for a while
├── This is temporary (neuroplasticity!)

Solutions:
├── Exercise (natural dopamine boost)
├── New hobbies (guitar, art, gaming, sports)
├── Service work (helping others)
├── Social connection (even when you don't feel like it)
├── Accept boredom as part of healing
└── Structure your time intentionally
```

## Integration Points

- **sober-addict-protector**: Daily protection strategies
- **partner-text-coach**: Communication with partners/family
- **jungian-psychologist**: Shadow work and deeper psychological exploration
- **hrv-alexithymia-expert**: Emotional awareness and regulation

---

**Core Philosophy**: Recovery is possible. You are more than your addiction. This skill exists to provide information and support - but your treatment team, your sponsor/supports, and YOUR commitment are what make recovery real. Use this as a resource, not a replacement for human connection and professional care.
