## Grounding Techniques

### 5-4-3-2-1 Sensory Grounding

**Purpose**: Bring attention to the present moment when feeling anxious, dissociated, or craving.

```
FIND AND NAME:

5 things you can SEE
├── Look around the room slowly
├── Name them out loud: "I see a brown desk, a green plant..."
├── Notice colors, shapes, textures
└── Really look, don't just glance

4 things you can TOUCH
├── Feel your feet on the floor
├── Touch the chair beneath you
├── Notice temperature, texture
└── "I feel the cool metal of this chair..."

3 things you can HEAR
├── Close your eyes if comfortable
├── What's in the background?
├── Near sounds and far sounds
└── "I hear the AC humming, birds outside..."

2 things you can SMELL
├── What's in the air?
├── Bring something to your nose if needed
├── Coffee, lotion, fresh air
└── "I smell coffee from the break room..."

1 thing you can TASTE
├── What's in your mouth right now?
├── Take a sip of water
├── Notice subtle flavors
└── "I taste mint from my toothpaste..."
```

**When to use**: Panic attacks, dissociation, intense cravings, flashbacks, overwhelming emotions.

### Box Breathing (4-4-4-4)

```
        Inhale 4 seconds
            ┌─────┐
            │     │
Hold        │     │  Hold
4 sec       │     │  4 sec
            │     │
            └─────┘
        Exhale 4 seconds

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Breathe IN through nose for 4 seconds
2. HOLD breath for 4 seconds
3. Breathe OUT through mouth for 4 seconds
4. HOLD empty for 4 seconds
5. Repeat 4-8 cycles

WHY IT WORKS:
├── Activates parasympathetic nervous system
├── Lowers heart rate and blood pressure
├── Interrupts panic/anxiety cycle
└── Used by Navy SEALs for stress management
```

### 4-7-8 Breathing (Relaxation)

```
Inhale: 4 seconds (through nose)
Hold:   7 seconds
Exhale: 8 seconds (through mouth, with whoosh sound)

BEST FOR:
├── Falling asleep
├── Calming after a stressful event
├── General anxiety reduction
└── Not ideal during acute panic (too slow)

DO 4 CYCLES MAXIMUM when starting.
Can feel lightheaded at first.
```

### Body Scan Meditation

```
PROGRESSIVE BODY SCAN (10-15 minutes)
─────────────────────────────────────

Lie down or sit comfortably. Close eyes.

Start at the top of your head.
Notice any sensations: tension, warmth, tingling.
Don't try to change anything. Just notice.

Move slowly down:
├── Forehead
├── Eyes, cheeks
├── Jaw (often holds tension)
├── Neck and throat
├── Shoulders (breathe into tension)
├── Arms, hands, fingers
├── Chest (notice breath)
├── Belly (let it soften)
├── Lower back
├── Hips
├── Thighs
├── Knees
├── Calves
├── Feet, toes
└── Whole body together

If mind wanders, gently return to body.
No judgment. Just noticing.
```

## DBT Skills

### TIPP (Temperature, Intense Exercise, Paced Breathing, Paired Muscle Relaxation)

**For crisis moments when emotions are overwhelming.**

```
T - TEMPERATURE
───────────────
├── Hold ice cubes in your hands
├── Splash cold water on your face
├── Hold a cold can against your neck
├── Take a cold shower
└── WHY: Activates dive reflex, rapidly lowers heart rate

I - INTENSE EXERCISE
────────────────────
├── Run in place for 1 minute
├── Do jumping jacks
├── Sprint up and down stairs
├── Any vigorous movement for 5-10 minutes
└── WHY: Burns off stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline)

P - PACED BREATHING
───────────────────
├── Exhale longer than you inhale
├── 4 seconds in, 6-8 seconds out
├── Breathe from your belly
├── Slow down your exhale
└── WHY: Activates parasympathetic response

P - PAIRED MUSCLE RELAXATION
────────────────────────────
├── Tense a muscle group for 5 seconds
├── Release and notice the difference
├── Pair with slow exhale on release
├── Work through body: fists, arms, shoulders, face, etc.
└── WHY: Can't be physically tense and relaxed simultaneously
```

### Opposite Action

**When emotion doesn't fit the facts or acting on it would be harmful.**

```
EMOTION          URGE                OPPOSITE ACTION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fear             Avoid/escape        Approach what you fear
Anger            Attack/yell         Gently avoid, take space
Sadness          Withdraw/isolate    Get active, reach out
Shame            Hide/avoid          Share with safe person
Guilt            Apologize/fix       If unjustified: let it go
                                     If justified: make amends

EXAMPLE:
Feeling: Fear of calling sponsor
Urge: Avoid, "I'll call later"
Opposite: Call NOW

The action changes the emotion over time.
```

### Radical Acceptance

```
RADICAL ACCEPTANCE
──────────────────

WHAT IT IS:
├── Fully accepting reality as it is
├── Not approval or agreement
├── Not giving up or being passive
├── Stopping the fight against what IS
└── "It is what it is"

WHAT IT'S NOT:
├── ❌ "This is okay"
├── ❌ "I like this"
├── ❌ "I give up"
├── ❌ "I won't try to change things"
└── ❌ "I deserved this"

THE FORMULA:
Pain + Non-acceptance = SUFFERING
Pain + Acceptance = PAIN (which passes)

PRACTICE:
"This moment is exactly as it is."
"I cannot change what has already happened."
"I can accept this AND work to change the future."
"Fighting reality doesn't change it."

BODY PRACTICE:
├── Relax your face, especially forehead
├── Unclench your jaw
├── Drop your shoulders
├── Open your hands (no fists)
├── Half-smile (changes brain chemistry)
└── Willing hands (palms up, accepting)
```

## Cognitive Techniques

### Thought Records

```
THOUGHT RECORD TEMPLATE
───────────────────────

SITUATION: What happened? (Just facts)
_________________________________

EMOTION: What did you feel? (0-100%)
_________________________________

AUTOMATIC THOUGHT: What went through your mind?
_________________________________

EVIDENCE FOR the thought:
_________________________________

EVIDENCE AGAINST the thought:
_________________________________

ALTERNATIVE THOUGHT: What's a more balanced view?
_________________________________

EMOTION NOW: (0-100%)
_________________________________

EXAMPLE:
─────────
Situation: Sponsor didn't return my call for 2 hours

Emotion: Rejected (80%), Anxious (70%)

Automatic thought: "They don't care about me. No one does."

Evidence FOR: They usually call back faster. I've been
calling a lot lately.

Evidence AGAINST: They have their own life and job.
They've shown up for me many times before.
2 hours isn't that long.
They called back eventually.

Alternative thought: "They're busy and will get back to me.
Past behavior shows they do care."

Emotion NOW: Rejected (30%), Anxious (20%)
```

### Cognitive Distortions Checklist

```
COMMON THINKING TRAPS
─────────────────────

□ ALL-OR-NOTHING: "I relapsed once, I'm a total failure"
  → Reality is usually shades of gray

□ CATASTROPHIZING: "If I mess up, everything will fall apart"
  → What's the evidence? What's most likely?

□ MIND READING: "They think I'm pathetic"
  → Can you actually know what they think?

□ FORTUNE TELLING: "I know I'll relapse eventually"
  → The future isn't written yet

□ EMOTIONAL REASONING: "I feel like a failure, so I am one"
  → Feelings aren't facts

□ SHOULD STATEMENTS: "I should be over this by now"
  → Says who? Replace with "I'd prefer" or "I'm working on"

□ LABELING: "I'm an addict, that's all I am"
  → You are more than any single label

□ PERSONALIZATION: "They look upset, it must be my fault"
  → Other people have their own stuff going on

□ DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: "That doesn't count because..."
  → Let good things count!

□ MAGNIFICATION/MINIMIZATION: Making negatives bigger,
  positives smaller
  → Try to see things at actual size
```

## Urge Surfing

### The Complete Script

```
URGE SURFING MEDITATION (10-15 minutes)
────────────────────────────────────────

Find a comfortable position. You can close your eyes
or soften your gaze.

Notice that you're having an urge or craving right now.
This is uncomfortable, and that's okay.

First, let's acknowledge: this urge is just a sensation.
It's a wave that will rise, peak, and fall.
It cannot hurt you. It cannot make you do anything.

Now, find where you feel the urge in your body.
Is it in your stomach? Your chest? Your throat? Your hands?
Just notice where it lives.

Rate the intensity from 1 to 10. ___

Breathe into that area. Don't try to push the sensation away.
Just breathe and notice.

Imagine you're sitting on a beach, watching waves.
This urge is a wave. Watch it approach.

Notice how the intensity rises...
(pause)
And rises...
(pause)

Now notice: is it still rising, or has it peaked?
Cravings typically last 15-30 minutes.
They always pass.

Keep breathing. Keep watching.

Notice the intensity now. Has it changed?
Rate it again from 1 to 10. ___

You are not your urge. You are the observer of the urge.
The wave is passing through you, not destroying you.

(Continue breathing for 5-10 minutes)

When you're ready, notice:
├── You survived this urge
├── You didn't have to act on it
├── It rose and fell, just like waves do
└── Each time you surf an urge, you get stronger

Slowly return your attention to the room.
```

**Remember**: These skills work better with practice. Try them when you're calm so they're available when you're in crisis. Talk to your counselor about which ones work best for you.
