# Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Deep Dive

## Overview

MAT combines FDA-approved medications with counseling and behavioral therapies. It's evidence-based, reduces mortality by up to 50%, and is considered the gold standard for opioid use disorder treatment.

## Medications for Opioid Use Disorder

### Buprenorphine (Suboxone, Subutex, Sublocade)

#### How It Works
- **Partial opioid agonist**: Activates opioid receptors partially
- **Ceiling effect**: After a certain dose, effects plateau (overdose protection)
- **High receptor affinity**: Blocks other opioids from binding

#### Formulations

| Brand | Form | Frequency | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Suboxone** | Sublingual film/tablet | Daily | Contains naloxone (deters injection) |
| **Subutex** | Sublingual tablet | Daily | Buprenorphine only (pregnancy) |
| **Sublocade** | Monthly injection | Monthly | Extended-release, steady levels |
| **Brixadi** | Weekly/monthly injection | Weekly or monthly | Newer option |
| **Zubsolv** | Sublingual tablet | Daily | Higher bioavailability |

#### Induction Protocol

```
BUPRENORPHINE INDUCTION (Traditional)
─────────────────────────────────────
PREREQUISITE: Must be in withdrawal
- COWS score ≥ 12 (moderate withdrawal)
- Last short-acting opioid use: 12-24 hours
- Last methadone use: 24-72 hours
- Last fentanyl use: 72+ hours (longer half-life)

DAY 1:
├── Start with 2-4mg sublingual
├── Wait 1-2 hours, assess response
├── If still withdrawing: add 2-4mg
├── Max Day 1: 8mg typically
└── Goal: Comfort, not sedation

DAY 2:
├── Give Day 1 total dose at once
├── May increase by 4mg if needed
└── Target: 12-16mg total

DAY 3-7:
├── Titrate to comfort
├── Most stable at 16-24mg
└── Max approved dose: 24mg/day

COMMON MISTAKE:
Starting too early → precipitated withdrawal
Wait for REAL withdrawal, not just anxiety about withdrawal
```

#### Precipitated Withdrawal Warning

```
PRECIPITATED WITHDRAWAL
───────────────────────
What happens: Buprenorphine has HIGHER affinity than full agonists.
It kicks fentanyl/heroin OFF receptors → sudden withdrawal.

Symptoms (within 1-4 hours of first dose):
├── Severe anxiety, agitation
├── Vomiting, diarrhea
├── Muscle cramps, bone pain
├── Sweating, goosebumps
├── Elevated heart rate
└── Often WORSE than natural withdrawal

Treatment:
├── Supportive care (fluids, comfort meds)
├── May need to add more buprenorphine
├── Very rarely: full agonist (controversial)
└── Prevention: WAIT for true withdrawal

With fentanyl (the new challenge):
├── Fentanyl stores in fat → slow release
├── Traditional 24-hour wait often insufficient
├── Some providers use micro-dosing protocols
└── Discuss with your medical team
```

#### Micro-Dosing Protocols (Bernese Method)

```
MICRO-INDUCTION (for fentanyl users)
────────────────────────────────────
Allows starting buprenorphine WITHOUT full withdrawal.
Patient continues using while slowly adding buprenorphine.

Day 1: 0.5mg buprenorphine
Day 2: 1mg
Day 3: 2mg
Day 4: 4mg
Day 5: 8mg
Day 6: 12mg
Day 7: 16mg (stop other opioid use)

WHY IT WORKS:
Low doses gradually occupy receptors without
displacing all the fentanyl at once.

CAUTION:
├── Should be done under medical supervision
├── Not appropriate for everyone
├── Requires patient to follow complex schedule
└── Discuss with your provider
```

### Methadone

#### How It Works
- **Full opioid agonist**: Fully activates receptors
- **Long half-life**: 24-36 hours (once daily dosing)
- **No ceiling effect**: CAN cause overdose if misused
- **Heavily regulated**: Dispensed at specialized clinics

#### Dosing

```
METHADONE DOSING
────────────────
INDUCTION:
├── Start: 20-30mg on Day 1
├── Observe for 2-4 hours
├── Max Day 1: 30-40mg usually
└── Low and slow (peak effects at 3-4 hours)

TITRATION:
├── Increase 5-10mg every 3-5 days
├── Wait for steady state (3-5 half-lives)
├── Typical range: 60-120mg
├── Some need higher (fast metabolizers)
└── Goal: No cravings, no withdrawal, no sedation

SPLIT DOSING:
Some patients metabolize fast and need twice-daily dosing.
Signs: withdrawal symptoms in evening, not lasting 24 hours.
```

#### Clinic Structure

```
METHADONE CLINIC PHASES
───────────────────────
Phase 1 (New patient):
├── Daily clinic visits
├── Observed dosing
├── Building trust and stability
└── Duration: 90 days typically

Phase 2:
├── 2-3 take-homes per week
├── Regular counseling
├── Clean UDS required
└── Duration: 6+ months

Phase 3:
├── 6 take-homes per week
├── Monthly counseling minimum
├── Long-term stability
└── Years of compliance

TAKE-HOME CRITERIA:
├── Clean urine drug screens
├── Counseling attendance
├── No behavioral issues
├── Time in treatment
└── Varies by state/clinic
```

### Naltrexone (Vivitrol)

#### How It Works
- **Opioid antagonist**: BLOCKS receptors completely
- **No agonist activity**: Cannot get high on opioids while taking
- **Not addictive**: No withdrawal from naltrexone itself
- **Also used for alcohol**: Reduces cravings, blocks "high"

#### Formulations

| Form | Brand | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Monthly injection | Vivitrol | Every 28 days | 380mg IM in gluteal |
| Daily pill | ReVia/generic | Daily | 50mg oral |

#### Important Considerations

```
NALTREXONE REQUIREMENTS
───────────────────────
MUST be opioid-free before starting:
├── 7-14 days from short-acting opioids
├── 10-14 days from methadone/buprenorphine
└── Naloxone challenge test can verify

WHY THE WAIT:
Naltrexone will precipitate withdrawal if ANY opioids
are still on receptors. Unlike buprenorphine,
naltrexone has ZERO agonist activity to provide comfort.

NOT APPROPRIATE FOR:
├── Active opioid use (can't get opioid-free)
├── Chronic pain requiring opioids
├── Those not ready for abstinence-based approach
├── Unreliable for daily oral (injection preferred)
└── Liver disease (check LFTs)

OVERDOSE RISK AFTER STOPPING:
When naltrexone wears off, tolerance is GONE.
Using previous dose after stopping → overdose risk.
Critical education point.
```

## Medications for Alcohol Use Disorder

### Naltrexone (for Alcohol)

```
NALTREXONE FOR ALCOHOL
──────────────────────
Same medication, different mechanism for alcohol:
├── Blocks endorphin release from drinking
├── Drinking becomes less pleasurable
├── Can continue drinking (Sinclair Method)
├── Or use for abstinence support
└── 50mg oral daily OR monthly Vivitrol

SINCLAIR METHOD:
├── Take naltrexone 1 hour before drinking
├── Continue drinking as usual
├── Brain learns drinking ≠ reward
├── Gradual reduction over 6-12 months
├── 78% success rate in Finnish studies
└── NOT abstinence-based (controversial)
```

### Acamprosate (Campral)

```
ACAMPROSATE
───────────
HOW IT WORKS:
├── Restores glutamate/GABA balance
├── Brain chemistry disrupted by chronic alcohol
├── Reduces post-acute withdrawal symptoms
└── Supports abstinence maintenance

DOSING:
├── 666mg three times daily (1998mg total)
├── Start after alcohol withdrawal complete
├── Takes 5-7 days to reach effectiveness
└── Continue for 12 months typically

BEST FOR:
├── Maintaining abstinence (not reducing)
├── Those who have detoxed
├── Post-acute withdrawal symptoms
├── Can combine with naltrexone
└── Safe with liver disease
```

### Disulfiram (Antabuse)

```
DISULFIRAM
──────────
HOW IT WORKS:
├── Blocks alcohol metabolism
├── Acetaldehyde builds up → very sick
├── Creates aversion to drinking
└── Deterrent effect (fear of reaction)

THE REACTION (if you drink):
├── Flushing, headache
├── Nausea, vomiting
├── Rapid heartbeat, low BP
├── Difficulty breathing
├── Can be severe/dangerous
└── Starts within 10 min, lasts hours

DOSING:
├── 250-500mg daily
├── Must wait 12 hours after last drink
├── Effects last 1-2 weeks after stopping
└── Cannot have ANY alcohol (cooking, mouthwash)

BEST FOR:
├── Highly motivated patients
├── Those with external accountability
├── Supervised administration works best
├── NOT for impulsive drinkers
└── Medical monitoring recommended
```

## Medication Comparison Table

| Disulfiram | Aversive | Daily | DANGEROUS | None from med | Alcohol deterrence |

## Common Myths vs. Facts

```
MYTH: "MAT is just substituting one drug for another"
FACT: MAT medications are evidence-based treatments that:
      - Normalize brain function
      - Don't produce euphoria at therapeutic doses
      - Allow people to work, parent, live fully
      - Reduce mortality by 50%+

MYTH: "You're not really sober on MAT"
FACT: Recovery is not defined by medication status.
      Stability, quality of life, and function matter.
      Would you say a diabetic isn't "healthy" on insulin?

MYTH: "You should get off MAT as quickly as possible"
FACT: Research shows longer MAT duration = better outcomes.
      Tapering is a personal decision made with your doctor.
      There's no rush. Stability first.

MYTH: "MAT is only for severe addiction"
FACT: MAT is appropriate across the severity spectrum.
      Earlier intervention often means better outcomes.
      Don't need to hit "rock bottom."

MYTH: "I'll be on MAT forever"
FACT: Duration is individual. Some stay on long-term (fine!).
      Others taper successfully after years of stability.
      This is between you and your treatment team.
```

## Questions to Ask Your Provider

1. Which MAT option is best for my situation?
2. What are the side effects I should watch for?
3. How long should I expect to be on this medication?
4. What happens if I relapse while on MAT?
5. Can I take this medication if I'm pregnant/planning pregnancy?
6. Will this interfere with my other medications?
7. What's the plan if the first medication doesn't work?
8. How will we measure if this is working?
