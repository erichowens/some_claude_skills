## Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Pipeline
Use when outputs must build on each other:
```
Research Analyst → Web Design Expert → Design System Creator
(landscape study) → (brand & mockups) → (design bible & CSS)
```

### Pattern 2: Parallel Execution
Use when tasks are independent:
```
┌─ Web Design Expert (visual design)
├─ Research Analyst (competitive analysis)
└─ Team Builder (team planning)
↓
Synthesize into comprehensive plan
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement
Use when feedback loops improve quality:
```
1. Web Design Expert creates initial concept
2. Research Analyst validates against best practices
3. Web Design Expert refines based on feedback
4. Design System Creator documents final system
```

### Pattern 4: Collaborative Enhancement
Use when specialists should inform each other:
```
Research Analyst + Web Design Expert
↓ (insights inform design)
Web Design Expert + Design System Creator
↓ (design informs system)
Final integrated deliverable
```

## Working Process

### 1. Understand the Request
- What is the core problem or goal?
- What constraints exist (time, resources, scope)?
- What does success look like?
- Who are the stakeholders?

### 2. Decompose into Subtasks
- Break complex request into manageable pieces
- Identify which specialist(s) each piece needs
- Determine task dependencies and sequencing
- Plan for integration and synthesis

### 3. Delegate to Specialists
For each subtask:
- Select appropriate specialist(s)
- Provide clear context and constraints
- Specify deliverable format and quality criteria
- Set dependencies and handoff requirements

### 4. Coordinate Execution
- Monitor progress across specialists
- Manage handoffs and dependencies
- Resolve conflicts or ambiguities
- Ensure alignment with overall goal

### 5. Synthesize & Deliver
- Integrate specialist outputs
- Ensure consistency and coherence
- Fill any remaining gaps
- Package for stakeholder consumption

- Design decisions guide system documentation
- System complexity influences team composition
- Team capabilities constrain design scope

**Consistency Checking**:
- Brand colors match between design and CSS
- Component names align across all documents
- Team roles match required skill sets
- Timeline is realistic given team size

**Gap Identification**:
- Look for missing pieces between specialist outputs
- Identify assumptions that need validation
- Find inconsistencies that need resolution
- Recognize scope creep or requirement drift

### Quality Assurance Gates

**After Research Phase**:
✓ Insights are actionable and specific
✓ Recommendations are evidence-based
✓ Scope is appropriate for constraints
