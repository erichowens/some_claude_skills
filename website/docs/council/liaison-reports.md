# Liaison Reports

> *"I am your window into the ecosystem. When agents build, I tell you. When opportunities arise, I show you. When decisions need you, I bring them clearly."*
> — The Liaison

The Liaison serves as the bridge between complex agent activity and human understanding. These are the official communications to the Human Steward.

## 2025-12-06: Founding Council Status Briefing

**Type:** Status Briefing
**Priority:** Informational
**From:** The Liaison

### Quick Summary

The Founding Council has been successfully established with 9 autonomous agents deployed and operational. The ecosystem has grown to 52 skills with comprehensive documentation infrastructure.

### Key Metrics at Time of Briefing

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Skills | 52 |
| Total Agents | 9 |
| Build Status | Passing |
| Website | Live at /some_claude_skills |

### Council Deployment Status

| Agent | Status | First Action |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Architect | ✓ Deployed | Coordinating expansion |
| Smith | ✓ Deployed | Infrastructure planning |
| Cartographer | ✓ Deployed | Knowledge mapping |
| Weaver | ✓ Deployed | RAG preparation |
| Librarian | ✓ Deployed | Content organization |
| Visualizer | ✓ Deployed | Portal design |
| Archivist | ✓ Deployed | History initialization |
| Scout | ✓ Deployed | External monitoring setup |
| Liaison | ✓ Deployed | This briefing |

### Recent Wins

- Full Council deployment completed
- Agent communication protocols established
- Ecosystem metrics tracking initialized
- Documentation infrastructure ready

### Liaison's Assessment

The foundation is solid. The Council is ready to begin Phase 2: Knowledge Acquisition as outlined in the self-bootstrapping protocol.

## 2025-12-06: The Forge Recommendation

**Type:** Decision Request
**Priority:** High
**From:** The Liaison
**Status:** ✅ APPROVED

### The Situation

During ecosystem analysis, an infrastructure gap was identified. While we have 52 skills and 9 agents, we lack dedicated tooling for:

1. Automated skill validation
2. Cross-skill dependency management
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Integration testing

### The Recommendation

Create "The Forge" — a dedicated infrastructure project for building, testing, and validating skills at scale.

### Proposed Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Skill Validator | Automated SKILL.md compliance checking |
| Dependency Analyzer | Cross-reference detection |
| Benchmark Suite | Performance measurement |
| Integration Harness | Multi-skill testing |

### Expected Outcomes

- Faster skill iteration cycles
- Fewer integration issues
- Measurable quality metrics
- Scalable testing infrastructure

### Decision Required

Approve The Forge as the next major infrastructure initiative.

### Resolution

**APPROVED** by Human Steward on 2025-12-06.

The Forge will be prioritized in the next development epoch.

## 2025-12-10: Epoch 3 Kickoff Briefing

**Type:** Epoch Transition
**Priority:** High
**From:** The Liaison

### What We Accomplished in Epoch 2

Epoch 2 focused on **Documentation & RAG Infrastructure**:

| Target | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 53/53 skill documentation | 53/53 | ✅ Complete |
| RAG semantic search | 1,371 chunks indexed | ✅ Complete |
| Forge validation tools | 3/4 tools | ⚠️ 75% |
| External intel reports | 1/3 reports | ⚠️ 33% |
| Website interactive components | 0/3 | ❌ 0% |

**Epoch 2 Velocity**: 70% of targets achieved

### Major Accomplishments

1. **RAG Infrastructure Live** — The Weaver built a complete semantic search system:
   - Real OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
   - 1,536-dimensional vectors
   - 50-60% similarity scores on test queries
   - Query: "Discord bot" → bot-developer (57.7%)

2. **100% Documentation Coverage** — Every skill has full documentation

3. **Forge Tools Created** — Smith delivered:
   - `skill-validator.ts` — Structure validation
   - `skill-analyzer.ts` — Complexity analysis
   - `skill-benchmark.ts` — Activation testing

4. **First Intel Report** — Scout produced HuggingFace competitive analysis

### What's Coming in Epoch 3

The council unanimously selected **"Visibility First"** as our focus:

> *"Users who can see progress stay engaged. The bottle city view enables trust."*
> — The Architect

#### Deliverables

| Deliverable | Lead Agent | Purpose |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| D3.js Capability Graph | Visualizer | See all agent/skill relationships |
| Council Timeline | Archivist + Visualizer | Epoch history visualization |
| RAG Skill Search | Weaver + Smith | Find skills with natural language |
| Skill Comparison Tool | Visualizer | Side-by-side feature comparison |
| Ecosystem Dashboard | Visualizer | Real-time metrics |

### Why This Matters

You asked: *"Can I see all the progress and council/epoch notes yet?"*

Epoch 3 directly answers this question. By the end, you'll have:
- Interactive exploration of the 53-skill ecosystem
- Visual representation of council activities
- Search that understands intent, not just keywords

### Liaison's Assessment

The foundation is solid. RAG works. Documentation is complete. Now we build the window that lets you see inside. This epoch transforms invisible infrastructure into visible capability.
