# What Are Claude Skills?

**Turn Claude from a helpful assistant into a domain expert—instantly.**

## First, Some Context

### What is Claude?

Claude is an AI assistant made by [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com). If you've used ChatGPT, it's similar—you can ask it questions, have conversations, get help with writing and coding. Many developers prefer Claude for its nuanced reasoning and ability to handle complex technical tasks.

### What is Claude Code?

[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is a command-line tool that lets Claude work directly with your files and code. Instead of copying and pasting code back and forth, Claude can:

- **Read your files** - Understand your entire codebase
- **Write code** - Create new files, edit existing ones
- **Run commands** - Execute tests, build projects, run scripts
- **Search and navigate** - Find what it needs across thousands of files

Think of it as having a senior developer who can actually touch your codebase, not just give advice.

### What are Skills?

Skills are instruction files that give Claude deep expertise in specific areas.

**Without a skill:** You ask Claude for help with color theory. You have to explain what you're building, what "warm/cool alternation" means, that you care about perceptual uniformity, what LAB color space is... and hope Claude pieces together something useful.

**With the Color Theory skill:** Claude already knows all of this. It understands earth-mover distance for palette optimization, knows when to use HSL vs LAB, and produces color systems that actually work. You just say "help me pick colors" and get expert-level output.

Skills are like giving Claude a master's degree in a specific topic—the knowledge is just *there*.

2. **Come back here** - Once you're up and running

### If You Already Use Claude Code

```bash
# Clone all skills
git clone https://github.com/erichowens/some_claude_skills.git

# Now Claude knows all 49 skills
```

Or grab just the ones you want from the [Skills Gallery](/skills).

## How Skills Work

Skills are markdown files that live in `.claude/skills/`. When you mention a skill or Claude detects it's relevant, the instructions get loaded into context.

A skill file typically includes:
- **Who this expert is** - The persona and mindset
- **What they know** - Domain knowledge, frameworks, best practices
- **How they work** - Methodologies, decision-making processes
- **What tools they use** - Specific libraries, commands, techniques

Example: The `typography-expert` skill doesn't just know "use readable fonts." It knows about optical sizing, x-height ratios, combining typefaces, vertical rhythm, and the specific CSS properties to achieve each effect.
